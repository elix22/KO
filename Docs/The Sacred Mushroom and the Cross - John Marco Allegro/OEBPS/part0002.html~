   <p>In the New Testament we can penetrate to the second layer of literary composition, where every word of the story can be examined for possible word—plays. Thus, for example, "silencing the storm" is a pun on the fungus name, *MASh_BA(LA)G..., which provided the myth-makers with the Semitic root sh-b — kh, "pacify",23 and is so used of Yahweh in Psalm 6.c: "who does still (Hebrew mashbiakh) the roaring of the seas, the roaring of their waves..." (v. 7). The Sumerian name GI—LI—LI(LI—LI—GI), properly the "reed with two cones" describing the two halves of the volva separated by the stem of the mushroom, gave by word-play the Semitic root g-l-l, "waves", and the proper name Galilee.24</p>
   <p>The sacred mushroom, then, was a being of two worlds, heavenly and terrestrial. Its affinities in the heavens lay with the stars, and in a special sense it was the child of Venus, the morning and evening star. The heavenly dew which this luminary was thought to disperse on the earth was considered of special power, and the appearance of the mushrooms on the ground at dawn seemed evidence of a special relationship between the star and the fungus.</p>
   <p>The Heavenly Twins, the Gemini or Dioscouroi, were identified with the Morning Star, as is Jesus in the New Testament. These mushroom characters were similarly credited with power over storms, since the sacred fungus was itself a product of the storm-god in the tempest. So far we have looked at those aspects of the mushroom which offered the mythologists material for descriptions and stories from its characteristic shape, and from its unique conception as a "child of God". We saw how its sexual form, male and female, gave rise to androgynous names and epithets, and how the conjunction of penis and vulva as fancifully seen in its most developed form offered comparison with the human copulatory act and similar sexual imagery in the axe— head and the cross. The significance of its heavenly origin appears in those stories about the mushroom which portray the heroes quelling storms, and theologically,</p>
   <p>in imparting to its worshippers a knowledge of heavenly things normally beyond the reach of mere mortals.</p>
   <p>We may now take our quest further, and discover how other characteristics of the mushroom, and of the Amanita muscaria in particular, offered even wider scope to the myth—maker, classical and biblical. Its colour in particular seems to have made a deep impression on the ancient world, to judge from the way fungus names are used for red and purple dyes. Furthermore, the cap of the Amanita muscaria has a strange, white—flecked appearance deriving from the particles of the volva still adhering to the surface. This, as we shall see, gave a cycle of mushroom stories all its own.</p>
   
   <h2>XIV. Colour and Consistency</h2>
   <p>How, it may be asked, can one be sure that it was one particular member of the fungus species that was the subject of the sacred mushroom cult? Even the canopied Boletus type offers a wide range of specimens, and more than one kind of this variety has in its cap a hallucinatory drug.l The answer is that the sacred mushroom was characterized in name and mythology by its distinctive colouring, the deep red of the cap contrasting with the white stem, and with the white or yellowish "warts" standing out against the red, remnants of the broken volva from which it grew. In the following chapter we shall look at the names deriving from the colour and "scabby" form, of the Amanita muscaria, and how its distinctive appearance contributed in no small measure to the awesome wonder with which its worshippers regarded the fungus, and the stories woven around it.</p>
   <h3>The Fleecy Cloak</h3>
   <p>The colour characteristics of the sacred mushroom provided folklore with a number of day-to-day allusions, among them being that the red top flecked with white particles seemed like a red woollen cloak or "fleece". The most famous of all classical myths derived from this characteristic is the story of the quest for the "Golden Fleece" by Jason and the Argonauts. By "golden" in this context we have to think of the red gold most common in the ancient world, rather than the purer, yellow metal of modern jewellery. The story runs as follows:</p>
   <p>Phrixus and Helle, the two children of the Boetian king Athamas, were hated by their step— mother mo. Their lives were threatened and Hermes gave them a fabulous ram on which they fled to safety. The ram had a fleece of gold and could fly as well as reason and speak. The two children climbed onto its back and flew off. Helle fell off as they crossed the sea named after her, Hellespont, "Helle's Sea" (Dardanelles), but Phrixus managed to remain aboard until they reached Colchis on the Black Sea. The unfortunate ram was then sacrificed, and its wonderful fleece offered to the king of that country, Aeetes, who hung it on a tree and set a dragon to guard it night and day.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile at loichus in Thessaly, one Jason, attempting to win back part of his rightful heritage of the kingdom from his wicked uncle Pelias, was set the task of finding and bringing back the Golden Fleece. With the help of Hera and Athene he built a fifty-oared ship called the Argo, in which he had set a bough of the prophetic oak of Zeus at Dodona. Among his heroic crew were the Dioscouroi, setting the mushroom seal firmly upon the myth. After many adventures the Argonauts managed to lull the dragon and seize the Fleece and make good their escape, with the help of the king's daughter Medea, who went with them. She married Jason and they lived happily for ten years before the hero fell in love with another and abandoned Medea. She avenged herself by sending the new bride a costly robe which, immediately it was put on, consumed her with inextinguishable fire.2</p>
   <p>The ram was a prime symbol of fecundity in the ancient world but this story illustrates another of its virtues: its hair was of great importance for weaving outer garments and tent-cloths. In Sumerian the same word DARA is used of the animal and for hair dyed red. When the latter significance was required a determinative SIG, "hair", could be put before the word. From the reversed combination DARA-SIG, the Greeks obtained their word for "hair" generally, thrix, through</p>
   <p>*tra_igs.s Properly it meant "red hair" and it is probably with this sense that a similarly derived word Thraikos is used of the people of Thrace, the "Thracians", the "red—headed people".4 Dionysus was a Thracian god,5 and his frantic Maenads were called Threiciae. But the reference here is probably not primarily to the homeland of the cult but to the "red-cloaked" Amanita muscaria that sent them berserk. This may have been what Josephus had in mind in a particular reference to the Jewish priest—king Alexander Jannaeus. Following an abortive revolt by his Jewish subjects against him, the king is said to have crucified eight hundred of his subjects in Jerusalem, about the year 83 BC. So, says Josephus, the people called him a "Thracian".6 This may have been an allusion to a suspicion that he was an eater of the sacred mushroom himself, or to the popular imagery that linked the mushroom with the cross of crucifixion. It would seem from one of the names given by Dioscorides to the Mandrake that i,/ was also called by the name "Thracian".68 It would be interesting to know if the people of Thrace, apart from their religious interest in the red—"haired" Amanita muscaria, were themselves "redheaded" as their name implies. Certainly they were famed for their viciousness on the field of battle, and it is interesting that the idea that associates red—headed people with quick tempers persists even to this day.7 In the Old Testament, the story of how the crafty, smooth-skinned Jacob managed to trick his red, rough-skinned brother Esau out of his birthright is another presentation of the "red-cloaked" mushroom theme in mythology.</p>
   <p>But Jacob said to Rebekah, his mother, "Behold my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth8 man. Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him, and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing." His mother said to him, "Upon me be your curse, my son; only obey my word, and go, fetch them (the kids) to me." So he went and took them and brought them to his mother; and his mother prepared savoury food, such as his father loved. Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son; and the skins of the kids she put on his hands and upon the smooth part of his neck; and she gave the savoury food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</p>
   <p>So he went in to his father, and said, "My father"; and he said, "Here I am; who are you, my son?" Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your first-born..." Then Isaac said, "Come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or nt." So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau." And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's handy.. (Gen 27:11—23). Esau's name, as we may now recognizes from the Sumerian *E-ShU-A, "raised canopy",9 a fitting epithet for one who represented in mythical form the cap of the Amanita muscaria, as his brother Jacob (Sumerian *IA..A_GTJB, "pillar") was the mushroom stem. 10 The "redness" of his skin is remarked upon in the story of the twins' birth:</p>
   <p>And Isaac prayed to Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren; and Yahweh granted his prayer, and Rebekah his wife conceived. The children struggled within her and she said, "if it be thus why do I live?" So she went to enquire of Yahweh, and Yahweh said to her, "Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples born of you shall be divided; the one shall be stronger than the other, the elder shall serve the younger." When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold there were twins in her womb. The first came forth all red, all his body like a hairy mantle;ll so they called his name Esau" (Gen 25:21—25). So striking was the colour of the cap of the Amanita muscaria that it gave its name to red or purple dyes in the ancient world. Of such was the Greek phoinix, the "Phoenix", name of the palm tree, the bird, and the Levantine coast, as well as a famous purple dye. As we shall see, the Greek word was derived from a Sumerian phrase "mighty man holding up the sky", a fanciful descriptive epithet of the mushroom. 12 The Latin tablion, also, denoting the purple fringe of authority, derives also from the Sumerian *TAB_BA_LI, literally "double-cone", or "cup" being the two halves of the split mushroom volva.13 Of particular interest for our study is the Sumerian word GAN-NU, used of the red dye cochineal. 14 This, also, derives very probably from the red top of the Amanita muscaria, since GAN also means a cone or hemispherical shape, such as the lid of a bowl,l or a woman's breast. It is from this latter use in the fuller Sumerian phrase AGAN, "breast", that Greek obtained its name for the mushroom, Amanita, properly the "breast—shaped object", referring to the cap. 16</p>
   <p>From the Sumerian GAN-NU, denoting the red dye, came the Hebrew word khJniin for the red cap or daub put as a protection on the head of ewes in pasture. 17 Such a red cap well described the pileus of the Amanita muscaria, and it provided a most useful epithet for the sacred mushroom to the New Testament myth-makers. For khjnan looks exactly like another Semitic word meaning "be gracious", source of many personal names in the Old Testament, like Khanan, Hanan; KhJniin, Hanun; Khannah, Hannah; Yo-khJnJn ("Yahweh has been gracious"), John (Greek Idannes), and so on. 18 Thus, seeking Semitic personal names for their characters in the Gospel stories, the writers had in these "gracious" Old Testament names a rich store from which to choose. We have thus an "Anna", and "Annas" and several "Johns". The colour reference of the latter name is particularly clear in the case of John, the brother of James, the Boanerges. The name James is, of course, the English representation of "Jacob" (Greek Iakobos, Hebrew Ya'aqob), whose brother in the Old Testament story is Esau, the "red— skinned" one, and the counterpart of the New</p>
   <p>Testament "John".</p>
   <p>In the better known "John the Baptist", the colour reference is also prominent. The myth_makers/have simply added to the name the Semitic epithet Tabbal, "the c'ipper" (baptizer), or "dyer",19 derived ultimately from the same Sumerian *TAB_BA_R/LI, "mushroom", that gave Accadian its tabarru, "red dye", and Latin its tablion, "purple fringe", just mentioned. The name and title of "John the Baptist" in the New Testament story then, means no more than the "red-topped mushroom", but in giving him the added fungus name, *T_BA_LI, the story—tellers were able to assign him an important role in the story as the "baptizer" of Jesus and others. In the added descriptions and stories of this desert prophet in the Gospels further mushroom names and epithets were played upon.</p>
   <p>Now John wore a garment of camel's hair... (Matt 3:4).</p>
   <p>The prophet's description is modelled, of course, on that of Elijah, the Old Testament prophet who "wore a garment of hair-cloth" (II Kgs i :8).20 But the New Testament writer's addition, that the hair came from a "camel" is an interesting illustration of the way he and his fellow exegetes adapt the ancient traditions to fit their purposes. The point of "camel" here is that the Hebrew name for the animal, kirkarah,21 formed a useful word-play or pun on the Greek name for the Mandrake, Kirkaia. In fact, we may now trace back both words to a common Sumerian root, KUR-KUR, a name of the Holy Plant. It means "two cones":</p>
   <p>Applied to the mushroom it denoted the two halves of the volva, like TAB-BA-LI above, and to the camel, the double hump.</p>
   <p>And his food was locusts and wild honey (Matt 3:4).</p>
   <p>The "locusts" part of the prophet's diet has given the biblical naturalists much trouble. There were, of course, edible locusts known in those times, but popular tradition fancied the Carob as the most likely reference of the text, and today the Ceratonia Siliqua is known as "St John's Bread".22 Unfortunately, this Carob is not a desert plant, so discussion on the identity of the "locust" has continued unabated. In fact it now seems much more likely that the source of the reference is another wordplay between the Semitic gobay, guba', "edible locust", and gab'a, "mushroom". The similarity is not accidental: both come from a Sumerian root, GUG, "pod", the locust reference being to the larva of the insect, the mushroom's to the volva from which it develops.23 Even the popular designation of the Carob as "St John's Bread" is not all that removed from the truth, since the Carob, as we have seen, shared at least in ancient Accadian the same name as the mushroom.24 No story in the New Testament has so gripped the imagination of authors, artists, opera librettists, and others than that of the death of John the Baptist at the instigation of a jealous woman:</p>
   <p>But when Herod heard of it he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised." For Herod had sent and seized John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her. For John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife." And Herodias had a grudge against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not, for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him he was much perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly. But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and the leading men of Galilee. For when Herodias' daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, "Ask me whatever you wish and I will grant it." And he vowed to her, "Whatever you ask me, I will give it, even half of my kingdom." And she went out and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?" And she said, "The head of John the baptizer". And she came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, saying, "I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter." And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. And immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard and gave orders to bring his head. He went and beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.. (Mark 6:16—28).</p>
   <p>The whole story is woven from names of the sacred mushroom. The most obvious word-play is between the "Baptist's" name, Tabbala'; the "platter" (Latin tabula, borrowed as tabid' into Semitic); and the mushroom TAB-BA-LI.25 But other, more subtle punning has provided most of the details, such as the "banquet for the men of Galilee",26 the offer of gifts "unto half my kingdom",27 the prophet being "bound in prison",28 and so on. The "daughter of Herodias" or "the little heron" as the name means, is a piece of mushroom nomenclature, as is the use of the name "Herod" itself throughout the story. Here, as elsewhere, real—life characters feature in the story, otherwise quite fictional, largely because their names lent themselves to easy punning on mushroom names or epithets. Red and White</p>
   <p>It is the deep red of the canopy of the Amanita muscaria that first attracts attention. But closer examination shows that the red background is flecked with white, the wart—like remains of the volva adhering to the cap.</p>
   <p>The "flaky" nature of the white particles- also contributed to mushroom nomenclature and folklore. In the sau story, for example, it was not only the redness of his skin that marked him off from his smooth brother Jacob, but the roughness of its texture, an allusion to the "scabby" cp of the mushroom. In the vision of the Amanita muscaria that must now seem the most likely reference of the first chapter of the book of Revelation, the mystic, being "in the Spirit", as he says, saw this white flecking of the shining "sun"-like face of the mushroom as white wool I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet saying, "Write what you see in a book..." Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the lamp- stands one like a son of man, clothed with a long robe, and with a golden girdle round his breast; his head and his hair were white as white wool, white as snow; his eyes were like a flame of fire, his feet were like burnished bronze, refined as in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many waters; in his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth issued a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in fill strength (Rev 1:10— 16).</p>
   <p>Such a distinctive and striking appearance as that presented by the cap of the Amanita muscaria gives us a great advantage in our search for old mushroom names. But it leads us into strange places and into comparisons with the most unlikely objects, animals, plants, and even gems which, apart from their colour characteristics, have little to do with the mushroom. This is largely why the mythology and symbolism of the sacred fungus has managed to keep its secrets for so long.</p>
   <h3>The Panther</h3>
   <p>In the Jewish Talmud, Jesus is sometimes referred to as Bar PanderJ', "Son of (the) Panther".30 Most fanciful ideas were expressed about someone called "Panther" whose relations with the Blessed Virgin and paternity of the Babe were the subject of much rich speculation by the Jews of later times, to the annoyance of the Christians. But the epithet has remained a mystery and has survived even the zealous activities of the Christian censors largely because its relevance had been forgotten. We can now see that it is, in fact, a descriptive title of the sacred mushroom, the Semitic word being a transliteration of the Greek pant her, our "panther". The reference is to the markings of the animal's coat, described by Pliny as "sinai! spots like eyes on a light ground".31 The ancient botanists must have used the name of the animal for the fungus, just as today the near—relative of the Amanita muscaria, Amanita panther — ma, is so named among modern mycologists.32</p>
   <p>References to the Christian "Jesus"-figure occur but sporadically in old Jewish traditions, for it is here that the Christian censors, who came to control most of the libraries of the civilized world, have understandably been most active. Where the name does occur, it is often attached to epithets or "incidents" whose significance has been lost. These now need a thorough re-examination, for the "Pandera" references show conclusively that the early Jews were well aware of the original mushroom nature of the Christian cult, even though, later, through persecution and the passage of time, this knowledge was lost or, at least, no longer expressed in literary form. In the New Testament, a straight pun is made on the descriptive title of the fungus, when one of the "red-cap" figures, Annas, is said to have been the "father—in—law" (Greek pentheros) of Caiaphas (John 18:13). This piece of information is unsupportable from historical sources,83 and probably quite untrue. It is merely one item in a grouping of mushroom epithets which include also the title of the high priest, Caiaphas, properly "Overer", but used in the New Testament, along with Peter's surname, "Cephas", as a play on the mushroom word, Latin cepa.34</p>
   <p>We are now able to trace the origin and thus basic meaning of the THE SACRED MUSHROOM AND THE CROSS</p>
   <p>Greek panther.35 It comes from the Sumerian BAR, "skin", and the word we met before with the meaning "red-wool", DARA. Another use of DARA is with the significance of "spotted, variegated in colour" and so*BAR_DARA will have meant "spotted, variegated skin", and came dialectally into Greek as panther, as a descriptive title of the peculiarly marked animal. 0 In Hebrew this same original phrase can now be recognized behind its word for the gumBedolakh (Latin Bdellium).37 The Old Testament in-, eludes it among the sources of comparison when it describes the heaven— sent Manna of the wilderness (Num 11:7). The Manna, as we have already noted, is to be understood as the mushroom, and the reference to Bdellium is due to the appearance of that gum, containing, as Pliny says, "a number of white spots, like fingernails".38</p>
   <p>The Opal, or Paider6s, "the beloved"</p>
   <p>The same derivation and appearance leads us into the realm of precious stones in our search for mushroom epithets. The stone Opal, Latin Opalus, is probably related through its distinctive</p>
   <p>colouring with the mushroom, whose name (Sumerian *U_BzjL)39 it bears. The Greeks called the stone, Paiderds, and again we turn to Pliny for an early de— scription of this gem:</p>
   <p>The defects of the opal are a colour tending towards that of the flower of the plant called Heliotrope, or of rock—crystal or hail, as well as the occurrence of salt—like specks or rough places or dots which distract the eye the dominant colour of the Paederos is a mixture of sky-blue and purple</p>
   <p>Those in which the brilliance is darkened by the colour of wine are superior to those in which it is diluted with a watery tint.40</p>
   <p>The name PaiderJs is also given to a thorn, Akanthos, "with a reddish root and a head like a thyrsus (penis)",41 and to a vegetable dye of a purple colour.42 A point of special interest in the name is that Pliny assumes that it comes from the Greek pais, paidos, "boy, son", and erotis, "beloved", and that it is related to the Greek paiderastes, "boy—lover", usually in the bad sense of our "pederast".43 He says the stone earned its name through being "exceptionally beautiflul".44</p>
   <p>The New Testament, apparently recognizing the specific mushroom application of the name, meaning "red and white spotted skin", plays upon this understanding of Paiderds on a number of occasions. For example, when Jesus is being baptized by John in the Jordan, a voice from heaven calls out, "this is my son, the beloved" (Matt 3:17), precisely the pais-erotis false etymology of Paiderds displayed by Pliny in his description of the opal.</p>
   <p>Similarly, taking "son" as meaning "disciple", the New Testament myth-makers offer us the cryptic epithet, so long the subject of speculation, "the disciple whom Jesus loved", that is, the "beloved—son", pais — erotis, Paiderds. A particularly interesting example of this epithet appears in the story of the Last Supper:</p>
   <p>When Jesus had thus spoken he was troubled in spirit and testified, saying, "Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me." The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke. One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was lying in Jesus' bosom; so Simon Peter beckoned to him and said, "Tell us who it is of whom he speaks." So lying thus, in Jesus' bosom, he said to him, "Lord, who is it?" Jesus answered, "It is he to whom I shall give this morsel when I have dipped it." So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot (John 13:21—26).</p>
   <p>Here again we have the "dipping" theme derived from a play on the mushroom name *TAB..BA.LI and the Semitic root t-b-1, "dip, dye". The words "the disciple whom Jesus loved", the Paideriis, "red and white spotted skin", continue the colour allusions of the passage. The "Scabby One " andLapisLazuli</p>
   <p>The characteristic peeling, "scabby" aspect of the Amanita muscaria is also reflected in its nomenclature and mythology. The Arabs call the mushroom, "the scabby one", and it is probably this feature of the sacred fungus to which Isaiah refers when he warns the "daughters of Zion"46 engaged in witchcraft47 that "the Lord will make your crowns scabby and denude your vulva (?)" (Isa 3:17). The prophet seems to be alluding to the "scabby one" they were adoring in their cult, and the reference is probably the same when he has Yahweh complain to Israel that he had planted her as a vine48 and hoped to reap "justice" (mishpat), but had received for his pains only "fungi", scabs (mispakh), making a pun on the two words (Isa 5:7).</p>
   <p>As the reader will appreciate, it is only now that we are beginning to understand the significance of the mushroom cult in the ancient world that the relevance of many such passages and allusions in the prophetic writings of the Old Testament can be understood. This is not a matter into which we can go deeply in this work, but clearly one necessity for any future study of the prophetic writings will be to try and sift out all such cultic references and perhaps discover how far the prophetic movement in Israel was averse to the fungus cult completely, and how far the Yahwists of, say, the eighth century c, were merely making their stand against certain aspects of the old religion.</p>
   <p>One thing is now quite certain: the situation was never the clear— cut opposition of Yahwism versus the old fertility cults that later Jewish and Christian theologians liked to suppose. Yahweh was himself a fertility god,49 and the cult of the sacred mushroom against which Isaiah in certain passages like the ones above seems to be railing, was but an esoteric development of that fertility religion.</p>
   <p>But to return to our "scabby" mushroom. As one might expect, the flaking of the surface of the Amanita muscaria, with its "wart"—like particles of white skin against the red of the cap, reminded the myth- makers of sufferers from leprosy and other skin diseases. So we should be prepared to find in biblical stories concerned with lepers allusions to the mushroom. In the Gospels people so afflicted are commonly mentioned, but one "ulcerous" character claims our special attention, mainly because of his name, Lazarus (Luke i6 :19—3 i). On the face of it, "Lazarus" is simply a form of the Old Testament name Eleazar.50 But here, as so often with New Testament names, we have in an approximation to a biblical name an epithet of the mushroom. What the New Testament cryptographer had in mind here in his "Lazarus" was the word we know in English as "Lazuli", usually found in conjunction with "Lapis" ("stone") to describe a blue mineral containing flecks of gold, as Pliny describes it, adding that it can be "tinged with purple".SI</p>
   <p>Our name "Lazuli" comes from the Persian Lazhurward, and, as we can now trace it back, ultimately from a Sumerian phrase *AR..zAI,. DARA, "brightly shining variegated (stone)". The Persian form is simply a jumbled form of the Sumerian, and from it Semitic derived its Lazrad on which form the New Testament word-play with "Lazarus" was made.52 To the writer of the Gospel the significance of the name lay in the speckled, purplish colour of the Amanita muscaria, to which, in his description of the unfortunate beggar, he added the "scabby, ulcerous" appearance given by the warty surface of the cap: "moreover, the dogs came and licked his sores" (v. 21).</p>
   <h3>Barnabas, "Son of Consolation "</h3>
   <p>The reference to Lapis Lazuli furthermore opens up to us a line of approach which helps us solve another intriguing problem of New Testament nomenclature. The proper Sumerian name of the mineral is ZA-GIN, "flecked stone". These words came into Semitic in a variety of forms; the consonants underwent various dialectal changes en route, and they became jumbled out of their original positions. However, it is usually possible to pick out the new forms now that the phonetic correspondences can be recognized. In Hebrew, for instance, the Z—G-N of the Sumerian became s-p — r, giving sappir, "Lapis Lazuli", and the same form is found in the Greek sappheiros, our "sapphire", usually attached to quite another stone.53 From our more immediate point of view, a more interesting development was to produce the group n-b-s. Thus Accadian had nabJsu, "red dyed wool", and in Aramaic nabtisa is the name of a certain red woolly caterpillar that infects the Service tree, Sorbus domestica.54 The motif of "red flecked with white" continues in the Greek and Latin names of the "giraffe", ndbiis, which Pliny describes as "an animal with a neck like a horse, the feet and legs of an ox, a head like a camel, and is of a ruddy colour picked out with white spots", which is a good description of the colouration of the Amanita muscaria. It is, as now we see, the same n — b — s verbal group that is the significant part of the name of the New Testament character, "Joseph, called Barnabas":</p>
   <p>Now the company of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things which he possessed was his own, but they had everything in common... There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of what was sold and laid it at the apostles' feet; and distribution was made to. each as any had need. Thus Joseph who was surnamed by the apostles Barnabas (which means Son of Encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus, sold a field which belonged to him, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet (Acts 4:32—37). The surname of this philanthropist has caused the commentators much trouble in the past,56 for the New Testament cryptographer has given us another of his pseudo—translations, telling us that "Barnabas" means "Son of Encouragement". He implies thereby that the first part "Bar—" is the Aramaic "Son of—" and that the nabas at the end represents another Semitic word meaning "Encouragement". In point of fact, there is no extant root which offers that meaning and which looks like — nabas. The name is not, indeed, Aramaic at all: the first element is the Sumerian BAR, "skin", and the second is our "giraffe", "red—with— white-spots" word, the whole being yet another epithet of the Amanita muscaria.</p>
   <p>The pseudo-translation, "Son of Encouragement", refers not to Barnabas, but comes from a wordplay we have already met, between the roots Wi — n — n, "gracious, encouragement", and kh — n — n, "red" (our "red-cap").57 The writer points the way to decipherment himself when he says that Barnabas was "a native of Cyprus" (Kuprios). He and his readers were well aware that the Greek word for the red dye "Henna" is kupros, the Hebrew kopher, Aramaic kuphrJ'.58 The similarity which made the word—play here possible is not, as we can now appreciate, purely coincidental. Both go back to an original Sumerian GU-BAR, "top of the head; glans penis" ;59 in the case of the offshore island, the reference is to the old fertility geography of the area which saw the island as the tip of a penis awaiting entry into the "groin" of the mainland. The dye "Henna", kuphra', gave a colour which seemed to the ancients to resemble the suffused red of the glans penis.60 Even the philanthropist's first name, Joseph, had probably a similar reference in the myth-maker's mind. The name means, as we have seen, "Yahweh (semen) — penis", from Sumerian *IA..u_SIpA/SIB.61 Cognate with this is the name of the precious stone we know as "Jasper", the Greek iaspis, Hebrew yJshepheh, all deriving from a Sumerian *IA_ SIPA/SIB, "penis—stone", again referring to the colour of the glans.62</p>
   <p>The point of the story itself, the sale of the field and donation of its value, is another allusion to the "Akeldama" theme of the Iscariot story. It will be remembered that the story—teller played it in that instance on the idea that the miscreant's blood—money was used to buy a "field" which, because of its associations, became known as the "Field of Blood" (Acts I :19). As we shall see,63 word—play there is between the Aramaic demJ', "blood", and dJme, "price, value", and between 'akal, "food", and khaqal, "field". The real relevance of the name "Akeldama" was "food of compensation" or "atonement", being equivalent to other names of the Holy Plant which referred to it as God's atoning sacrifice made to the earth on man's behalf, the "price" of salvation. So, in the story of Barnabas' gift from the proceeds of the sale of his "field", the theme is the same, giving us a name of the sacred fungus, together with an afitision to its "Akeldama" title and cultic significance.</p>
   <h3>Joseph's "coat of many colours"</h3>
   <p>Our work enables us now to open up a major new line of approach to the patriarchal myths in the Old Testament, but on a smaller scale it also helps to solve a number of niggling points of Hebrew philology which, although not important in themselves, have served to remind us continually of our ignorance of so much early Semitic vocabulary. One such problem was the description of the tunic given to a more famous Joseph by his adoring father Jacob/Israel:</p>
   <p>Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a "coat of many colours" (or, as our modern translations have it, "a long robe with sleeves") (Gen 37:3).</p>
   <p>The older understanding of the nature of the tunic came from the early Greek translators who received a tradition that the rare Hebrew word passim meant "many coloured, spotted".64 More recent translators have favoured an alternative rendering which described not the colour of the garment but its shape and size. They have seen in passim a word meaning "palms of the hands", so that, somewhat improbably, the description implied that the sleeves of the tunic reached to the "palms", hence their "long robe with sleeves". Happily, thanks to the prompting of the "Barnabas" decipherment we can make a fresh assessment of the rare Hebrew word, finding in it a root cognate with the latter part of Barnabas' name and meaning "red, spotted with white", or, as a related Aramaic word denotes, "freckled".65 The Greek translators of Genesis are thus vindicated, and we traditionalists can cling on to our "coat of many colours" (AV, RV). To conclude: it is hardly surprising that the worshippers of the sacred fungus found in its distinctive colouring and surface texture a rich source of material for descriptive epithets and folk-tales. Our modern fairy- tale writers are no less attracted by the red—topped toadstool that decorates the covers of so many children's books. The classic story of the Golden Fleece has come from the "woolly" nature of the mushroom cap as the ancients envisaged it, and old words for "dyeing red" have their original reference to the Amanita muscaria. In the New Testament, the myth-makers seized upon the similarity between the Semitic word for "red-cap", to name a number of their characters, including John the "Baptist". The Jews have managed to preserve a name for Jesus, the "Panther", or "Spotted-skin", which shows that at first, anyway, the real significance of the Christian myth and cult was not lost to their contemporaries.</p>
   <p>Decipherment of the name of the "ulcerous" Lazarus, has led the way to appreciating for the first time the nature and meaning of the New Testament cryptographer's "Son of Encouragement", applied as a pseudo-translation to the colour epithet of the sacred fungus, "Barna-bas".</p>
   <p>One of the effects claimed for the hallucinatory drugs in the cap of the Amanita muscaria is that the subject sees objects and colours larger and brighter than life. Applied to the mushroom itself, the prime example of such drug-inspired vision is to be found at the beginning of the "Revelation to John", noticed on a number of occasions. But, as we can now appreciate, this enlarged view of the object of their adoration, had long before given the ancients a major source for their cosmographies, accounts of the beginnings of the world. They saw the whole universe as a monster mushroom, the earth as the lower "cup" of the volva, the heaven stretched out above as a great pilleus, supported on a pillar of some sacred mountain. Out of this conception came stories of giants holding up the canopy of heaven, and another source of folk-names and mythology of the mushroom. Furthermore, we can now begin to understand names given to the environs of Jerusalem, and the relevance of the proximity of the Dead Sea to the fertility cults centred on that city. On a larger scale, it is possible to appreciate the derivation and significance of names of the areas bordering on the eastern Mediterranean, regarded as the "crutch" of the earth and thus the entrance to her womb.</p>
   <h3>In the beginning was the volva...</h3>

   <h2>XV. Mushroom Cosmography</h2>
   <p>The cult of the mushroom produced its own cosmography. The volva of some vast primeval fungus split asunder, the lower hemisphere containing the amniotic fluid of creation, the biblical "deep", and the upper being forced upwards to make the canopy of heaven. In the Accadian version of the myth it is the creator, phallic god Marduk, "womb favourer", who splits the volva asunder. In this case, the volva is seen as the egg of a mighty serpent called Tiamat, the equivalent of the biblical tehom, "subterranean deep", or, as its Sumerian origin implies, "womb". It is Tiamat's body which forms in its two parts heaven and earth.' Properly speaking, the "serpent" in the mushroom physiology is the stem that arises from the volva to bear aloft the upper half as its expanded head, or, in phallic terms, its glans penis. Cosmographically, the mushroom stem is represented by a great mountain whose top is lost in the clouds of heaven. This was the seat of the gods, the Olympus of the Greeks, Saphon ("north") of the Semites, both names having reference to their cosmic functions. Olympus can now be shown to mean "city of the support of heaven",2 the Semitic Saphon, "north", means properly "the fulcrum". In Greek mythology, Atlas is a mighty giant standing in the west, holding aloft the heavens on outstretched arms. His name, as that of the mountain in North Africa that was identified with him, means "heavenly shade", Sumerian *ANDUL.AN.4 We noticed previously how our own word "giant" comes from a similar Sumerian designation, found in Greek form as the name of the mushroom. 5</p>
   <p>In the Semitic world of Canaan, it was Mount Hermon, "organ of support",6 which held up the sky. Farther south, Jerusalem, "city of the heavenly womb", as we may now interpret the name, was conceived as bearing up the "groin" of the sky as a phallus carries the splayed legs of a woman in coitus,7 and the axe-shaft the head. 8 The other name by which the Holy City was known, "virgin daughter of Zion" had a similar connotation.9 The "Atlas"-type of a man with arms outstretched supporting the roof we met earlier in discussing the origin of the name Pollux, the stem of the mushroom supporting the canopy, the upper half of the "womb" of his brother Castor.'O It was there seen that the derivation of "Pollux" from the Sumerian LU-GEShPU, "strong man", was paralleled in the formation of the New Testament name for the brothers James and John, the "Boanerges", so—called "Sons of Thunder". In the one case LUGEShPU became *pu_lu_ges and thus "Pollux", in the other, a phrase *GEShPU..AN_UR became *pu_an_ur_ges and thus "Boanerges". In mushroom terms, James (Jacob) is the "pillar" and John is the red— topped canopy.</p>
   <p>A very similar vocalic jumbling from the Sumerian occurred in the case of another Greek mushroom word which extended into extraordinarily disparate fields of reference, phoinix, our Phoenix. As the designation of the palm-tree it signified fancifully a kind of overgrown mushroom, the fronded leaves representing the canopy, the tall trunk, the mushroom stem. The Greek word comes from Sumerian *GEShPU_ IMI, with just the same meaning as *GESI-iPU_AN_UR, "strong man (holding up) the sky", the Boanerges. The development was as follows:</p>
   <p>*pu_imi_ges to *pu_ini_ges to the Greek phoinix. " It is the same mushroom connection that brought the Phoenix into the category of "womb- birds" mentioned earlier.'2 We noticed that the Phoenix was the centre of much speculation among classical and Christian writers about resurrection from the dead.</p>
   <p>Sumerian's common name for the palm-tree, GIShlMMAR, like the cognate Hebrew tamar, contains the element MAR, representing an inverted "V" shape. So it appears in words for the head of a double-axe or mattock, for a rainbow, and for a woman's crutch, or womb.'3 The Hebrew word and its cognates extend to forms like a sign-post, a column of smoke spreading into a "mushroom-cloud" at the top. The "small palm-tree" forms a significant part of the Temple decorations (I Kgs 6:29).14</p>
   <p>The close relationship in imagery between a mushroom and a palm- tree may help us to understand a curious reference in Pliny's description of the Essenes by the Dead Sea. He says that having renounced all sexual pleasures in their ascetic existence, they contented themselves with the "company of palm-trees" (socia palmarum). '5 Even the female variety of the palm one would have thought was hardly adequate consolation for celibacy. It is more likely that our author had heard that the cult centred around the "Phoenix-fungus" or "-gourd" and he knew the name only as referring to the tree.</p>
   <p>Perhaps the Greek phoinix is best known for its derived form Phoinikia, the home on the Levantine coast of those intrepid seamen of the ancient world, the Phoenicians. This geographical use of the name raises another interesting aspect of mushroom cosmography. Here the mushroom has to be imagined horizontally, lying on its side, so that the canopy forms the curving sweep of the Palestinian coastline. This, then, is the "crutch" of the earth, the "legs" being represented by the coast of Asia Minor in the north, and Egypt and North Africa to the south (fig. i). For the</p>
   <p>Mesopotamian myth-maker, the sun's glowing orb plunged every evening into this "vulva" of the west. 16</p>
   <p>The conception of the land mass at the eastern end of the Mediterranean as the earth's vaginal entrance is reflected in the biblical name of the area, Canaan, Hebrew Kena 'an, now to be recognized as from the Sumerian *KI...NA_AN (-NA), "nuptial couch of heaven". 17 Within the same general concept of fertility geography, the offhore island of Cyprus was reckoned as a "glans" poised for entry into the Canaanite womb, as is suggested not only by its name, Greek Kupros, from a Sumerian *GU_BAR..USh, "head of the erect penis",18 but also the importance of the fertility cults of Cinyras, already noted, and of Aphrodite.' 9</p>
   <p>In any population centre in the ancient Near East where a fertility religion was practised, the royal city and its cultic centre, the palace— temple, was the seat of the god's creative activity. It was thus the "uterus" to be sanctified and fertilized by his presence.2° It is in such terms that the topography and nomenclature of Jerusalem/Zion has to be understood.</p>
   <p>One story for the choice of the site for the Jewish Temple places it on "the threshing floor of Araunah" (II Sam 24:I5ff.). David had made a census of the people, the necessary prerequisite to an efficient income— tax system. Yaliweh (who had suggested it [v. i]) punished this act of impiety by sending a pestilence upon Israel from which seventy thousand men died in three days. The avenging angel was just about to smite Jerusalem in a similar way when the god called a halt, and at that spot David raised an altar to Yahweh and later his son Solomon built the Temple.21 Appropriately enough the place was a threshing floor, the Hebrew word for which means originally, as we see, "seed_container".22 The name of the owner, Araunah, may be explained similarly from the Sumerian as "pounder of the womb", that is, the phallus that grinds up the ingredients in the uterine "mortar". So the site of the god's creative activity for the future was the "belly" of the city and, in the eyes of the local religionists at least, of the world. So today the centre of the earth, the "navel", is portrayed in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, as in classical times the worshippers of Apollo found it in the temple at Delphi.23 South of the Temple area lay the Jebusite stronghold of Zion proper, the mons veneris, as it were, of the city (fig. i.). On its south—western flank was the Pool of Siloam ("place of washing") where Jesus sent the blind man to wash off the clay poultice he had laid on his eyes (John</p>
   
   <p class="illus">
    <img src="images/picture5.jpg" alt="picture5"/>
   </p>
   <p>\to rhe Deod</p>
   <p>Zion, and the valleys of Kidron and Hinnom</p>
   
   <p>9:7).24 The water of the Pool came from an underground conduit cut in the time of Hezekiali from the spring of Gihon on the other side of the hill. It was considered of such sanctity that the Temple cultus demanded that only Sioam water should be used in its special rites.25 Beneath the mons veneris was the junction of the two valleys circumventing the city on three sides (fig. 5). From the west, and sweeping round the south, was the valley of the "son(s) of Hinnom", the site, as we saw earlier, of the Molech cult.28 The name of the valley in Hebrew is simply an attempt to put into recognizable Semitic a phrase whose original Sumerian meant "penis—sheath", that is, "vagina" (*B&amp;J_ERuM).2? Below Zion, the valley combined with another, the Kidron, which cut the city sharply off on the east and separated it from the Mount of Olives. The resultant depression ran down through the desert to the south and east into the Dead Sea basin, the bowels of the earth (fig. 6).</p>
   <p>This gorge was the original "valley of the shadow of death", as its Hebrew designation salmaweth is wrongly translated in Psalm 23 4, and elsewhere. The real meaning of the original Sumerian *SILA_MUD means rather the opposite, "way of birth", that is, "birth.canal".28 Now the point of Molech having his "sperm-dedication" ceremonies here is clearly seen. So also can be appreciated the Psalmist's concern that his shepherd-god Yahweh should guide him by "rod and staff through the valley, that he should fear no evil. As a baby's fragile body needs the firm but gentle hand of the midwife as it is pressed into life through the vagina, so the religious mystic needed to put his hand in his god's as he passed through the experience of re-birth. The Arabs call the valley the Wady of Fire.29 It is well-named. Not only does the summer sun raise the temperature within its gorges to almost unbearable heights, but at its lower end it debouches onto the Dead Sea, the nearest point on the world's surface to the generative furnaces of mother earth's womb. Later theologians associated this heat to which the soul returned for purging and rebirth with retributive punishment for sins committed, so "the valley of the sons of Hinnom", or Gehenna as it became known, was identified with hell-fire, which had little to do with the original fertility concept.3°</p>
   <p>Reverting once more to the "vertical" aspect of mushroom cosmography, we have a good example in the Old Testament myth of Jacob and his ladder (Gen 28 :10ff).</p>
   <p>And Jacob came to a certain place, and stayed there that night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamt there was a ladder set up on earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending aix! descending on it!... Then Jacob awoke from his sleep, and said, "Surely Yahweh is in this place, and I did not know it." And he was afraid, and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven." Jacob's name means "pillar", properly "standing—stone" (Sumerian *IA_A_GuB).Si His equivalent in the Twin mythology of the classical world is Pollux, the "mighty man supporting heaycn". In the New Testament he is represented by James (Greek Iakdb),one of the Boaner— ges brothers, and a "pillar" of the Church (Gal 2:9). In mushroom terms, Jacob is the stem of the fungus, his "red- skinned" brother Esau is the scarlet canopy of the Amanita muscaria. As the phallic stem of the mushroom, Jacob is the "anointed one" running with the precious "semen" of the god.32 It is in the light of this aspect of mushroom physiology as seen by the ancients that the remainder of the Jacob's ladder story has to be understood. So Jacob rose early in the morning, and he took the stone which he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on top of it (vv. i8ff.).</p>
   <p>Another well-known Old Testament story illustrating the mushroom idea of a pillar reaching to the canopy of heaven is the myth of Moses and Mount Sinai. The name of the sacred mountain as we may now recognize means "brazier" (Sumerian ZA—NE) hence its description as "wrapped in smoke.. like the smoke of a kiln" (Exod 19:18).33 It is at the fiery head of this "brazier" that Moses meets Yahweh, and finds after the interview that his face is glowing so much that the people were afraid to approach him (Exod 34:29). Another important detail in the myth is the writing by the finger of God of the ten commandments on tablets of stone (Exod 24:12).34 The origin of the "tablets" theme is the "bun"—shape of the primitive clay tablet, resembling the top of a mushroom. Indeed, it is from one of the names of the fungus, the Sumerian *T41_BA..LI, "twin-cone", that, through Greek and Latin, we have received our word "tablet. The two slabs of stone in the story represent the two halves of the split mushroom volva.35 The "ten commandments" or "ten words" as they are known in the Bible, in their number and in their content are but word-plays on Sumerian fungus names.36 Later we shall look closer at these "Words" when we enquire more deeply into the moral content of the biblical writings. To the mushroom cosmographer, then, the universe was a "gigantic" (literally) fungus. At the base was the cup—shaped volva containing the waters of creation. The central pillar, variously identified with sacred mountains, supported the heavenly canopy. In sexual terms, the phallic pillar supported the sky, as the groin of a monstrous woman. On a horizontal plane, the same overall picture presented the land mass of the eastern Mediterranean as the "crutch" and offshore islands as the tips of penes awaiting entry into the vagina of earth's womb. Inland, the Jerusalem was the belly of the world, at least to the fertility cults centred in that city, and it was the beginning of the ever-deepening gorge of Gehenna which plunged down into the Dead Sea rift, the "bowels" of the earth.</p>
   <p>Here, again, is a field for much further research. If names like Jerusalem and Zion are primarily Sumerian and not Semitic, then we must seek a very early Sumerian influence in this area, which left later inhabitants not only designations of the city and valleys but a fertility cosmography in which Jerusalem played a central role. Other peoples elsewhere saw an equal importance in their own religious centres, as the Greeks revered Delphi, but whoever named Jerusalem, "city of the heavenly groin", understood this area to be the belly of the earth, and thus the main seat of the creator—god's activity. The idea that it was a Hebrew king called David that, around 1000 BC. instituted Yahweh worship here, in a previously "pagan" land (II Sam 6), must therefore be seriously questioned. Indeed, these present discoveries of the place of mushroom worship in the religion of ancient Israel, and the origin and nature of much Old Testament mythology, raise such doubts about the historicity of many aspects of the story of the Israelites. In the chapter that follows we shall see that even the account of the sojourn in Egypt must be radically re-examined. Whether it will ever be possible to draw a clear line of distinction between fact and fiction in the biblical records is very doubtful. The story of David, the hero-king, is a prime example of the dubiety which must now hang over the Old Testament as being in any sense a work of history, or based on history.</p>

   <h2>XV. David, Egypt, and the Census</h2>
   <p>In the Old Testament, David, the "lover" or "beloved" as we may render his name,l is the counterpart of the Semitic and classical Adonis, first among the fertility hero-gods of the ancient world. The name Adonis is related to the Semitic common noun 'adon, "lord". The root meaning of both we may now trace to the same Sumerian ANDUL, "heavenly shade", as gave the name Atlas to the mighty man of mytho— logy who holds aloft the canopy of heaven.2 The basic conception is one of "protection" and thus "lordship" in that sense of shielding the land and people from outward harm. The same picture is presented in another of the god's names, Na'iman, traceable now to a Sumerian *NA_flvA_AN, "stretched across the sky".3 Thus, within the mush— room cult, both names, Adonis and Na'iman can have a specific reference to the canopy of the fungus, viewed in the kind of cosmographical terms we have just discussed. Later, we shall look again at the Adonis— Na'iman figure in its particular application to the cultivation and use of the sacred fungus.4 For the moment, we may study more particularly his Old Testament representative David, whose Adonis and fertility connections are plainly set out in the oracle ascribed to his authorship:</p>
   <p>The oracle of Dayid, son of Jesse; the oracle of the erect phallus (RSV "the man who was raised on high"), the semen-smeared (RSV "anointed") of the God of Jacob, the Na'im ("heavenly canopy", RSV; "sweet") of the stretched penis (RSV: "psalmist") of Israel (U Sam 23 :x).</p>
   <p>The "patronymic" epithet, "Son of Jesse", is really an attempt to hebraize an original Sumerian *B,-ush...SA, "erect penis", thus conforming to the other phallic names given the hero figure. The phrase has some particular interest since in the form Briseus or Breseus we may now recognize it among the titles of the phallic Dionysus/Bacchus.5 In the description of David as the "Na'im of the stretched penis (z — m — r)</p>
   
   <p class="illus">
    <img src="images/picture6.jpg" alt="picture6"/>
   </p>
   <p>6 Jerusalem to the Dead Sea</p>
   
   <p>of Israel" there is a clear connection' with a passage in Isaiah about the "Adonis plantations": "You plant the plants of Na'iman (Adonis), you sow the penis (z — m — r) of the field (?)" (Isa 17: iO).6</p>
   <p>The English versions usually render the word in the David oracle as "songs" since the root z — m —r means also "sing". But this isjust another instance of the idea that singing was primarily a sexual activity whose function was to stimulate new life, demonstrably by causing an erection in the male organ. It is, thus, a cultic word, as singing, like lamentation, was part of the stimulatory worship of the fertility deity.7</p>
   <p>It is in this cultic phallic sense that we find z — m-r used again in Ezekiel's vision of the abominable practices being carried on in Jerusalem during his absence. Having been shown the women bewailing Tammuz/Adonis at the entrance of the north gate of the Temple:</p>
   <p>•. he brought me into the inner court of the house of Yahweh; and behold, at the door of the temple of Yahweh, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs to the temple of Yahweh, and their faces towards the East, worshipping the sun towards the East. Then he said to me, "Have you seen this, 0 son of man?... Lo, they stretch out the erect phallus before them" (RSV: "put the branch to their nose") (Ezek 8 :17).8</p>
   <p>The bearing of the phallus was a marked feature of the Dionysiac processionals, 0 but as we now know, it had more than a purely physiological significance. The penis was not only the sign of human generation but within the mushroom cult it symbolized the sacred fungus itself, the "phallus of God"</p>
   <p>The root z-m-r, "stretch out", is but a jumbled form of another root m — s — r or m — z — r of the same meaning, derived, as we may now appreciate, from a Sumerian word SUR, "stretch out, measure a boundary"! 0 Its use and word-play in cultic mythology has probably caused more misunderstanding in later generations about the history of the Jews than almost any other. We happen to know that one of the names of the mushroom was the "stretched gourd", for it has come down to us, transliterated in Greek from the old language of the North African Semites, as Koussi Mezar, and confused, as so often with names for the fungus, with the Squirting Cucumber. 11 The root m-z-r/m-s-r is also known in Semitic as the designation of the country of Egypt, "The Territory", or in the dual form, as normally in Hebrew, "The Two Territories", that is, Upper and Lower Egypt. So modern botanists have understood the old Semitic name Koussi Mezar as "the Egyptian gourd". And what the moderns have done unwittingly, the old myth- makers did intentionally: the sacred fungus was known as "the Egyptian mushroom", and from that playful designation was born the myth of the Israelites' sojourn in that land.</p>
   <p>The New Testament also took up the theme and has the Holy Family flee to Egypt to escape the highly improbable persecution by Herod "of all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under" (Matt 2 :i3ff.). It cites as justification of the exercise the text from Hosea:</p>
   <p>When Israel was a lad I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son (Hos ii:i).</p>
   <p>Israel as the god's first-born son in Egypt is the theme of the whole of the captivity and deliverance cycle of the Exodus. Thus Moses is commanded to approach Pharaoh with these words:</p>
   <p>Thus says Yahweh, Israel is my first-born son, and I say to you, "Let my son go that he may serve me"; if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay your first-born son (Exod 4:23).</p>
   <p>The carrying out of this threat to kill all the first-born of the land of Egypt forms the setting for the institution of the Passover. After the escape, Yahweh commands:</p>
   <p>Consecrate to me all the first-born; whatever is the first to open the womb among the people of Israel, both of man and beast, is mine (Exod 13 :z).</p>
   <p>Earlier on in this book we examined the philosophy of the fertility religions of the ancient world with regard to the special favour ascribed to the first—born, connected as it is with th power of the first menstrual blood of the virgin. Custom demanded that these specially endowed offspring should be returned to the god as a token towards restoring the balance of nature disturbed by their birth and human appropriation. 12</p>
   <p>This is the cultic background of the Exodus Passover tradition, but the story itself hinges on the play between the name of the fungus as Mezar, "erect, stretched", and Masor, "Egypt", to set the place of the myth; and upon the common Semitic name of the mushroom, Pitra ', and the root p — t —r which gave "first—born", "release", and "unleavened bread". The Hebrew story-teller thus had in the mushroom name and epithet the main ingredients of his Exodus story.'3</p>
   <p>The New Testament writers were not slow to see the possibilities of this Mezar epithet of the fungus for their myth-making. The root m-s-r in its various forms provides a rich harvest of puns for story-telling, and the New Testament abounds in instances. Perhaps the best known is the epithet given to Judas Iscariotl4 that has characterized him and those named after him throughout the civilized world, "he who betrayed him". 15 The verb m-s —r means "hand over" as a betrayal, particularly to Gentiles, so Iscariot is the arch—masor, "betrayer" of all time. Another word of different root but similar in sound is mesor, meaning "bonds, imprisonment". Playing on this word and the Mezor of the fungus, together with the p—t—r root, giving "Peter", the apostle, and pattird', "unleavened bread", we have the story in Acts which begins: and when he (Herod) saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of the Unleavened Bread. And when he had seized him, he put him in prison..." (Acts 12:3f.).</p>
   <p>"Pleasing the Jews" stems from the Sumerian mushroom name MASh-TAB-BA-RI, read as "that which is pleasing to the Hebrews (Jews)", by a word-play with Aramaic. 16 The name Herod, meaning "heron" (Latin ardeola) serves throughout the New Testament as a useful play on the Semitic 'Ardila', "mushroom", as does the feminine form "Rhoda" who opened the door to Peter after his release from prison (Acts 12:13).17</p>
   <p>Another form of "restriction" is the girdle or loin-cloth, and words for this in Semitic are similarly formed, as the Aramaic mesJrd'. Taking the old Punic name Koussi Mezar (properly *kisshuathl8 mesdrah, or the like), as the pattern, the myth-makers formed the play "girdle-clothing" (kesayj')19 that is, "waist—band, or loin—cloth". In the prophetic symbolism recorded of the seer Agabus, plays on both "girdle" and "betrayal, handing over" are extracted from the mushroom name:</p>
   <p>A prophet named Agabus2° came down from Judea. And coming to us he took Paul's girdle and bound his own feet and hands, and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit, 'So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.. (Acts 21 :iof.).</p>
   <p>The patronymic by which David is known in the Oracle quoted above, and elsewhere, "son of Jesse" is, as we have seen, also old Sumerian name for the erect phallus, *B_ush_sA. The same word, USh-SA appears again in the name of one of Jacob's sons, Issachar.2' The story of his birth is a good example of word-play based on a well- known name. But here the play is on a fanciful Hebrew derivation of the name and is obvious: indeed, the writer spells it out for us in so many words:</p>
   <p>In the days of the wheat harvest, Reuben [another of Jacob's sons] went out and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel [Jacob's barren wife] said to Leali, "Give me, I pray thee, some of your son's mandrakes." But she said to her, "Is it a small matter that you should have taken away my husband? Would you take away my son's mandrakes also?" Rachel said, "He can sleep with you tonight for your son's mandrakes." When Jacob came from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him, and said, "You have to have intercourse with me, because I have hired (s-k-i) you with my son's mandrakes." So he slept with her that night. And God favoured Leah and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son. Leah said, "God has given me my hire (s — k — i-)..." so she called his name Issachar (Gen 30:14—18).</p>
   <p>The author of this little tale fmds his theme in the fancied meaning of the name Issachar as 'ish, "man" and sakar, "he has hired", taking the name as if it were Hebrew. In the cycle of birth and naming stories con-' tamed in that and the previous chapter, the writer has tried to fmd in each of the names of Jacob's children sonie Hebrew root on which to make a punning reference to some aspect of his origin or character. Thus "Reuben" is understood as if it contained the roots r —'— h, "see", and '— n — h, "afflict" — "Yahweh has looked upon my affliction" ;22 "Sim— eon", as if it contained the root sh — m —', "hear" — "Yaliweh has heard that I am hated" ;23 "Levi", as if it were of the root I — w — h, "join" — "this time my husband will be joined to me" ;24 "Judah" as if it were of the root y — d — h, "praise" — "I will praise Yahweh",25 and so on. Even if the names were Semitic, let alone Hebrew, some of the sup-, posed derivations would be philologically impossible. Happily, myth- makers were not academic pedants, or the-world would be lacking some of its fmest literature. Such stories do not necessarily indicate whether or not the people who composed them had lost the real meanings of the names by that time, for word-play among the ancients, as we have seen, was a legitimate means of religious exposition and source of cultic story-telling. For the purposes of the plot and its moral, it was quite in order to spin out the old patriarchal names in this far-fetched way if the end-product served the cause of pious homiletics.</p>
   <p>However, there are passages in some of the older oracles of the Old Testament where it is clear that the writers were aware of the meanings of the ancient names. For example, of Issachar Deborah sings: Why did you lie between the sheep-folds, listening to the piping of the flocks? (Judg 5:16).</p>
   <p>Much the same phrase occurs of Issachar in the ancient oracle of Jacob on his sons:</p>
   <p>Issachar is a... ass, lying between the sheepfolds; and he saw a resting— place that it was good, and the land that it was sweet (na'imah) ; and he put his shoulder to the burden, and it was for him a worker's labour (Gen 49: i4f.).</p>
   <p>Now, in such oracular snatches we have word-play of a very dil&amp;rent order from those talesjust quoted. And because they are dealing with the real meanings of the tribal names, as distinct from the fanciful plays on supposed Semitic roots, we have hitherto been at a ioss to understand many of the references and allusions. Now at last we shall be able to start breaking them down, but it will be no easy task. Since they ceased to be understood from a comparatively early time, the chances are that many of the key words will have been changed during transmission. Happily oral traditions are not so susceptible to change as those which are passed on by the written word. Children will remember a poem or song by heart without necessarily understanding every word. We all have doubtless wondered in our youth why a "green hill" should need a "city wall" anyway. So for centuries the songs and oracles of the Old Testament will have come down exactly by word of mouth even though their dialects had ceased to be used, or the words had been carried out of their original territories.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless there will come a time when the poems will find written form, and the scribes will puzzle over forms and words quite strange to them. They will guess at their meanings and here and there substitute more common words, or even add the colloquial "explanation" alongside the original. The modem researcher has to try and sort out the different literary strands. But if he himself has lost the key — in the case of the oldest Hebrew writings, the nature of the cult from which they came — there is little he can do but wait and hope that further archaeological or philological discoveries may shed new light on the points of difficulty.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, when the writings become the central fount of authority for another religion, or a wayward development of the old, there is a temptation to make sense of the inherited scriptures at all points, and at any cost. In such cases basic principles of grammar and syntax, and a free admittance of lexicographical ignorance, too often give way before the need for pious exposition. To return to Issachar, "crouching between the sheep-folds". Deborah's taunt rests upon a wordplay on the Sumerian mushroom name, *LI...MASh..BA(LA)ANTA..TAB..BA..RI, read as "why are you resting (Semitic sh—b—kh, "be still, at peace") in the pasture?"26 The next line of the Jacob Blessing: "and he saw a resting-place and it was good..." gives a more obvious play on the Adonis mushroom name Na'iman (Semitic n —'— m, "be sweet").27 The last phrase: "it was for him a worker's labour" (Hebrew mas- 'obEd) provides a good instance of a change made in the text at some stage when the original word became dialectally out of fashion.28 The text probably first read mas-palakh and was intended as a play on MASh-BALAG of the mushroom name.29 Both phrases meant the same "forced labour" and to judge from the number of times that this theme appears in the Old Testament myths, it served their authors as a favourite source of word—play. The forced labour to which the Israelites were subject in their mythical sojourn in Egypt was in this way derived from the name of the sacred fungus. David's successor on the throne, Solomon, for all his much-vaunted wisdom in offering to share a baby between its rival claimant mothers with a knife (I Kgs 3:16—28), showed less acumen in demanding forced labour from his subjects (I Kgs 12:4). Furthermore, the same phrase also had the implication of making a census of the people and thus administering a tax as well as a work—levy system. Not unnaturally this kind of administrative advance was not welcome. One account of David's eventual fall from grace was that he had designed such a census and was punished by his god for doing so (II Sam 24).</p>
   <p>The MASh-BALAG-"census" theme of mushroom mythology gave the New Testament storyteller the dramatic means of bringing the pregnant Mary over a hundred miles of some of the roughest terrain in the world from Nazareth to Bethlehem to be delivered of the Christ child. It is the ungrateful pedant, or over—zealous religionist, who bothers overmuch about the likelihood that any Roman governor would have been so stark, raving mad as to require everyone in his territory to do a kind of "general post" to the place of their tribal origin for the purpose of being counted (Luke 2:3).</p>
   <p>That particular author could, however, have saved subsequent less imaginative readers a great deal of worry and spilt ink if he had not seized upon a recollection of the name of one Syrian governor, Quinnius, to add colour to the tale. Unfortunately Quirinius did not become governor until AD 6, and King Herod, in whose time the birth of Jesus was supposed to have taken place, died a decade or so earlier. 0 Still, even the best myth-makers cannot have everything their own way. The point of Quirinius (Greek KUrenios) is that his name nude an excellent word-play with both Grunon and Geraneion, Greek names of the fungus.3'</p>
   <p>The mushroom allusions in the snatches of song about Issachar are not only verbal. The "resting—place" sheepfold had a special significance in fungus imagery. It consisted basically of two barriers set out like a funnel, or an open "V" shape, through which the sheep could be driven into their fold.32 We have in this structure, the stylized configuration of the mushroom cap, supported by the stem, "lying between the folds". In human physiological terms, Issachar, "mighty penis", lies between the opened legs of the woman, and seeing "a resting place that it was good, and the land that it was sweet, puts his shoulder to the burden." To use another mushroom metaphor, Issachar stands ready to take up the yoke, or to bear his cross.</p>
   <p>The word-play used to produce this "resting-place of animals" from *LIMASh..BA(LA)(.ANTA..TAB..BA..RI, served also the New Testament writers for their story about the "stable" at Bethlehem:</p>
   <p>And while they were there, the time came for her to be delivered. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn (Luke 2:7).</p>
   <p>The authors spun out from that name of the sacred fungus "for him a resting-place in an animal's stall", as well as the more obvious play on pitrJ', "mushroom", and peter, "first—born".34 At a more basic level of mushroom mythology was the image of the fungus as a "manger" with a sheltering canopy held by the stalk above the "cradle" or "feeding trough" of the lower half of the volva. Possibly Euripides knows of a similar tradition to the Christian story when he has Pentheus order the unrecognized Dionysus to be carried off and "tied where the steeds are bound; let him lie in a manger, and stare into the darkness". 3</p>
   <p>Adonis, then, was the prime fertility hero-god of the ancient Semitic and classical worlds. We have seen how his names fit into the mushroom pattern, and it is also apparent that the Hebrew David figure is portrayed in the same phallic form. The Oracle ascribed to him paints him in these terms without any doubt, and his supposed patronymic, "Son of Jesse", is but an attempt to reproduce in Hebrew form a Sumerian name of the phallus and probably the mushroom. The tribal name Issachar has a similar derivation and again, in the oldest oracles referring to this character, its fungus nature is plainly evident.</p>
   <p>It appears that in the Old and the New Testaments, one of the old Semitic names for the mushroom, extant in a Punic version from North Africa, was misunderstood as suggesting an Egyptian origin for the fungus, and a resultant mythology brought Israel and the Holy Family from that country.</p>
   <p>The question must now be asked again, as indeed, these studies must continually provoke the enquiry, how much, if any, of these biblical traditions is history? Despite the obvious allusions to an Adonis background for many of David's epithets in the oracles and in the stories recounted about him, was there ever a real King David whose court chronicles gave some historical framework at least for the tales? Was there, for that matter, any Exodus, any Moses, any Abraham? One difficulty in sorting out fact from fiction in folk-tales is that the characters are often made so human that the listener finds it quite easy to imagine them as real people, even identify himself with them. Where the same themes have been treated over centuries of story— telling, successive narrators have embroidered the tales and made his characters more and more believable until the point comes when even the most far—fetched adventures, the most unlikely exploits, amatory, warlike, or muscular, do not deter us from wondering whether behind it all there was not a real Adonis, a real Hercules, a real David</p>
   <p>Well, perhaps there was. What we are concerned with in this present work is not trying to sift fiction from reality, the man David from the "stretched penis of Israel", but to find out what we can from the names and epithets and from the various mythologies of the ancient world, to what extent and in what ways the sacred mushroom was worshipped, and how far its cult was responsible for the later mystery religions of the Near East and Christianity in particular. It would not be surprising if real kings and heroes received names from their parents or their admirers traceable to titles of the mushroom, if they were adherents of the cult of the Holy Plant. Their historicity is not proved or disproved thereby. Nevertheless, if all we know of a character in our sparse records of the ancient world reflect only mushroom mythology, like Jacob and Esau, for instance, or Cain and Abel, then there seems little point in arguing that they were ever real people. If there was a real Jacob, good; but then it has to be admitted we know very little about him.</p>
   <p>A quite different situation obtains, however, with regard to the New Testament characters. Here, for reasons already stated and which by now should be apparent to the reader, we are dealing with a cryptic document. This is a different kind of mythology, based not on pious aggrandizement by later admirers, as has been so often assumed in the past, but a deliberate attempt to mislead the reader. There is every reason why there should not have been a real Jesus of Nazareth, at least not one connected with the sect of Christians, nor a real John the Baptist, Peter, John, James, and so on. To have named them, located their homes and families, would have brought disaster upon their associates in a cult which had earned the hatred of the authorities.</p>

   <h2>XVII. Death and Resurrection</h3>
   <p>We have earlier spoken of the treatment of death and resurrection in the fertility philosophy. 1 The ancients knew well that life and death are merely facets of the same creative process. To have crops in the Spring the land must die in the Autumn, and many of their myths deal with the "killing" of Nature after the harvest, and bringing itto life with the new agricultural year. This same experience of death and ressurrection is no less at the heart of the more sophisticated forms of the fertility cult, the mystery religions of which Christianity is the best known example. It seemed to the mystics that it might be possible to enact within the mind and body a spiritual "death" and "resurrection" so that, however anchored the mortal frame might be to a terrestrial existence, the soul could be released as if at death and given the freedom they believed it had experienced before birth and would do so again at death. Thus Josephus says of the Essenes, "It is a fixed belief of theirs that the body is corruptible and its constituent matter impermanent, but that the soul is immortal and imperishable. Emanating from the finest ether, these souls become entangled, as it were, in the prison-house of the body, to which they are dragged down by a sort of natural spell; but when once they are released from the bonds of the flesh, then, as though liberated from a long servitude, they rejoice and are borne aloft.."</p>
   <p>The way to this release of the soul was by asceticism and particularly by fasting, but the same effects could be achieved and more quickly by the use of drugs, like those Josephus says the Essenes sought out "which make for the welfare of the soul and body".3 Above all, the sacred fungus, the Amanita muscaria, gave them the delusion of a soul floating free over vast distances, separate from their bodies, as it still does to those foolish enough to seek out the experience. The Christians put the matter thus: "If the Christ is in you, although your bodies are dead through sin, your spirits are alive through righteousness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit which dwells in you " (Rom 8:xo,ii).</p>
   <p>Not only could the drug contained under the skin of the sacred fungus give to the initiate at will this illusion of spiritual resurrection, of victory over death, but in the conception and growth of the mushroom he could see a microcosm of the whole natural order. Before his eyes the cycle of life and death was enacted in a matter of hours. The Amanita muscaria was the medium of spiritual regeneration and at the same time in itself the supreme example of the recreative process in the world of Nature. No wonder the fungus attracted so much awesome wonder among the ancients, or that it inspired some of literature's greatest epics.</p>
   <p>To the mystic, the little red-topped fungus must have seemed human in form and yet divine in its power to change men and give them an in- sight into the mysteries of the universe. It was in the world, but not of it. In the New Testament myth, the writers tried to express this idea of the duality of nature by portraying as its central character a man who appeared human enough on the surface but through whom there shone a godlike quality which manifested itself in miracle-working and a uniquely authoritative attitude to the Law. The extent to which they succeeded can be seen today in the mingled sympathy and awe with which Jesus is regarded in the Western world, even among people for whom the Christian religion offers no attractions. The myth of the dying and rising god is variously treated within the mushroom cycle. One of the best-known stories is that of Persephone/ Kore, her mother Demeter, and the wicked uncle Pluto.4 The beautiful virgin who is the heroine of the tale presents in her double name the equivalent of the effeminate male Hermaphrodite. Her two names can now be seen as two aspects of the mushroom, Persephone being the volva (Sumerian *BM).sn3...u...NI, "container or the penis of fecundity") and Kore the stem of "phallus" (Sumerian *Gu_RI, as in the storm-god's name, *ush...Gu_p,J [ISKUR]).5</p>
   <p>Put in other fungus folk-lore terms, Kore is the charmed and erect "serpent", thrusting open the egg of Persephone. It is with this sense that *Sm..u...NI comes into Hebrew, in the form siph'oni, "adder", which has a specific mushroom reference in a passage in Isaiah. The prophet warns that those who "split" the "eggs of the siph'oni, adder", will bring death upon themselves, and those who weave with "spiders' spindles" (qore, the spindle rod with its whorl) will never weave such a web as will cover their cultic malpractices (s :5f.). Doubtless both these expressions will have been common folk-names for the mushroom.</p>
   <p>Persephone/Kore was passionately loved from afar by her uncle Pluto, god of the underworld. Although her father Zeus approved of the match, her mother Demeter (listed along with her daughter's names among those of the Holy Plant),8 strongly objected to the arrangement, not least because the marital home would have been outside her influence. However, Pluto, with the connivance of his brother, arranged that a large and beautiful flower7 should one day appear at the feet of his beloved as she walked in her Sicilian home. Unable to resist the blossom, the girl picked it, and immediately a yawning chasm appeared at her feet, revealing her suitor complete with chariot and horses to carry her off struggling to his subterranean palace. Not unnaturally, her mother was upset by the turn of events and began a long and variously recounted search for her daughter. Unhappily, even when she discovered her whereabouts, it was to find that the hapless child had eaten some magic herb8 that made it impossible for her to leave Hades for ever. An agreement was finally reached that she should remain in her husband's home for a third (or half) the year, and spend the rest of the time on earth with her mother. It has seemed strange to scholars that Pluto, the god of the underworld, should elsewhere be reckoned as a god of fertility. It is true that much of our western classical and Semitic tradition has led us to think of Hades9 as a place of dull lifelessness, or even of retributive torture of the damned. More original, as we have seen,10 is the conception of the earth's bowels as the seat of creation where all life is conceived and after death recreated. 11 In the subterranean oven, the god's seminal fluid is processed into living matter, and the Word made flesh. The name Pluto, Greek Plouton, is primarily a fertility word, now recognizable as coming from an original Sumerian *BURU_TUN, "deliverer of the womb", of which the element BURU, "deliver, release", is cognate with the Greek brud, "teem with, be full, burst forth".'2 The same Sumerian word appears in such names as Apollo, Aphrodite (from which comes our "aphrodisiac"), and the plant name Abrotonon, "Southernwood", a sprig of which under the pillow, Pliny tells us, "is the most effective countercheck of all to magical potions given to produce sexual impotence". 13</p>
   <p>A story with a similar ending to that of Persephone's myth is found related of Castor and Pollux. Following Castor's death in battle at the hands of his cousins who had driven away some cattle, brother Pollux was cast into despair. At last, in answer to a prayer to Zeus that he too might die and leave this earth to rejoin his twin in Hades, Father Zeus agreed that he might spend one day with his peers the gods and the other in the earth with his brother. "Thus," says Homer, "these two the earth, the giver of life, covers, albeit alive, and even in the world below they have honour from Zeus. One day they live in turn, and one day they are dead; and they have honour like unto that of the gods."4</p>
   <p>The death and resurrection story of Jesus follows the traditional pattern of fertility mythology, as has long been recognized. The hero is miraculously born, dies violently, returns to the underworld, and is then reawakened to new life. We may now go further and connect the details of the story more closely to the mushroom culture of which it is part. Indeed, the reference is plain within the text, where Jesus is made to relate his coming death by "being raised up" with the brazen serpent of Moses: "As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so shall the son of man be lifted up, so that all who believe in him shall have everlasting life" (John 3:14). The reference is to the incident recorded in Numbers 21:9: "And Moses made a brazen serpent and put it on a sign-post so that if anyone was bitten by a snake he might look on the brazen serpent and live."</p>
   <p>Easter and its Dionysiac equivalent</p>
   <p>Every springtime the Christian world celebrates its Easter festival when the Church focuses attention on the death and resurrection ofJesus. In the ceremony of the sacred fire and the dipping of "penis" candles into a "womb" font, previously noted, 16 tradition demonstrates clearly the sexual nature of the occasion. We are now able to draw some important parallels between the Christian festival and the Spring feast of the Dionysiac Anthesteria. On the twelfth of the month bearing that name (end of February to the beginning of March), there began a three-day festival of three parts, the Pithoigia, Choes, and Chutroi.'7 All too little is known from the records of the details of this great occasion; inevitably mystery rites were involved which were not for public viewing or recording. However, we are in a better position now to probe its secrets, not least because we can decipher its names.</p>
   <p>In the first place, "Pithoigia" had nothing to do with "wine—jars" (pithoi). '8 Indeed, the Anthesteria was not primarily a vine festival at all, despite early traditions to that effect, and Bacchus/Dionysus was not really a wine god, for all the colourful imagery that the name has long evoked. The confusion arose mainly through the "vine-cluster" symbolism that formed such an important part of the Bacchic regalia.</p>
   <p>The vine—cluster, like the ivy—cluster which also appears freely represented in Bacchic symbolism, evoked the shape of the conical end of the erect penis, the glans. The form is well illustrated in the earliest Sumerian ideogram for the vine,. The connection is explicit in the old names for the vine-cluster, like the Greek botrus and the Hebrew 'eshkoi, both derived, as we now realize, from Sumerian phrases meaning "top of the erect penis".20 So the Bacchic worshippers symbolized their god's phallic and mushroom connections by carrying with them a long rod, entwined with ivy and bearing at its end a vine- or ivy- cluster. This staff is called a Thyrsus, "womb-favourer; penis", as its Sumerian derivation now shows itto have originally meant. A modem Arabic version of the name is used for the mushroom.21 During the course of the Athenian festival of Skira, two male votaries of the goddess Athena, dressed as girls, carry vine-clusters between the temple of their goddess and that of Dionysus. The rare Greek word given to these objects, oskhos, we may now relate through its original Sumerian form to the Hebrew 'eshkoi, "vine_cluster".22 In the Song of Songs, the Shulammite's breasts are likened to such "vine-clusters", where the reference is certainly to the mushroom cap.23</p>
   <p>The "vine-cluster" became, then, a useful synonym for the sacred mushroom, and is used with this allusion in a composite picture of the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden given in the post-biblical book of Enoch. We noticed earlier how Josephus used this quaint literary device to portray in a roundabout way the phallic and mushroom significance of the High Priest's helmet.24 A number of plants are brought together to illustrate various aspects of the actual object being cryptically described. Taken at their face value the resultant picture is absurd, but each of the plants so adduced contains some allusion, by shape, or simply by a pun on its name, which, to the initiated, conveys the intended meaning of the whole. In the case of the Tree of Life, whose fruit made Adam and Eve like gods, the apocryphal writing says it had "the height of a fir, leaves like a carob, and fruit like a vine_cluster".25</p>
   <p>Each of the comparisons bears upon the sacred mushroom, the Amanita muscaria. The "fir" because it is a denizen of the conifer forests ;26 the "carob" because this "pod" name was given to both the mushroom and the food of pigs and "Prodigal Sons" ;27 and the "vine-cluster" because the red cap of the fungus was so pictured, as we saw above.</p>
   <p>The luckless sons of the prophets who found "death in the pot"28 when Elisha came to dinner, picked their mushrooms29 from a "vine of the field" (II Kgs 4:38—41). This phrase has all the appearance of a folk- name for the fungus, as "vine of the earth" has been preserved in Syriac as a name of the Mandrake.3° The same expression is used in the book of Revelation for the harvest to which the angel with the sharp sickle is bidden:</p>
   <p>Put in your sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe (Rev 14:18).31</p>
   <p>It is the same imagery of the "vine-mushroom" that described Jesus as "the true vine" (John i:i, s)' and in Jewish—Christian literature as "the Vine of David".32</p>
   <p>So whatever refreshment cheered the hearts of the Bacchic revellers we may be quite sure that it was not just wine, and the vine imagery of their regalia conveyed to the initiates a more potent means of intoxication than the juice of the grape alone. Very probably it was a dried and powdered form of the Amanita muscaria that they used to lace their drinik, and it was with this fiery beverage that they washed down the mushroom tops they chewed. In any case, many of the more important Dionysiac festivals took place in winter when vine culture had little to offer as an excuse for a wine-bibbing orgy.</p>
   <p>The second and third days of the Anthesteria were called hoi Khoes and hoi Khutroi respectively, which have been taken to mean, "the pitchers" and "the pots", and to have reference to some part of the wine-making ceremony. However, now that we need no longer see the mystic festival of Anthesteria as a mere vine-harvesting or wine-making jollification, we can find a much more meaningful significance in the names of its various parts. The second day's designation, hoi Khoes, read as a singular noun and article, is remarkably reminiscent of the oskhos ceremony just mentioned, where the objects carried are the "vine— clusters" of Dionysus.35 The name Khutroi given to the third day of the Anthesteria festival is cognate with the Semitic kotereth, "mushroom". The Greek word kuthros (kutros), "pot", with which the name has been hitherto identified, comes also from the same ultimate source (Sumerian GU-TAR, "top of the head; phallus"), but is probably secondary, referring to the mushroom or phallic shape of the container. 3 6</p>
   <p>Turning to the name of the feast itself, Anthesteria, we may now fmd its source in a Sumerian phrase meaning "raising of the penis" (*ANTA_ AShTAR),37 where "penis" will have its dual sense in the cult of the male organ and the phallic mushroom. That both aspects of the word were involved is indicated by the fact that the festival included a ritual marriage between the god Dionysus and the wife of the archon or chief magistrate.38 It is said to have involved a solemnization and consummation 39 of this mystic union, but exactly what physically took place we cannot know. The part played by cultic prostitutes in the mushroom- raising ceremonies we have earlier discussed,40 and something of the kind probably lay behind this holy marriage between the god and his mortal priestess. Recalling that exposure of the female genitals and application of menstrual blood was considered an essential part of releasing the fungus, it is worth noting that one at least of the days of the Anthesteria was marked as "taboo"( miara), properly "blood_stained".41</p>
   <p>A further confirmation of this is the tradition that on the day of Choes the celebrants anointed their doors with pitch,42 whose relationship with menstrual blood in the ancient philosophies has been previously noted.43 One is reminded also of the prophylactic daubing of doorposts and lintels with the blood of the Passover lamb by the Israelites inEgypt(Exod 12:7,22).</p>
   <h3>The Invocation and the Lord's Prayer</h3>
   <p>The cultic cry of the Bacchantes was the "paean", eleleu, eleleu.44 The elements of this invocation can now be traced back to the same Sumerian words that gave the Hebrews the name of their deity Elohim, translated "God" in our Bibles. It was a combination of Sumerian B-LA, "strong water juice", and IA—U/UIA,"juice of fecundity, spermatozoa", in other words, the common Semitic name for god, "El", combined with the tribal god name Yaliweh ("Jehovah"). In the invocation the original F-LA is doubled, and it is precisely this form that came down in the Bible in the chant of praise "Halleluia !"</p>
   <p>The cry eleleu, eleleu was so marked a feature of the Bacchic rites that the Bacchantes became known as the Eleleides,46 and the chant itself the "Paean", and associated with Apollo who had the same epithet, Paian, in Greek.47 The word, as we saw earlier, is another name of the mushroom, the equivalent of the New Testament's "Bar—jona", Peter's surname. 48 Now we can understand a reference in the botanist Dioscorides' account of the plant he calls "Hellebore", but which we can identify with the mushroom: "when they dig it they stand praying to Apollo and Aesculapius".4° The latter is also a name for the "Hellebore" and means simply "head of the erect penis, the glans", or in mushroom terms, the "cap". Clearly, at the point when the sacred fungus was removed from the ground, or perhaps when it was being induced to rise, the celebrants were required to chant the "paean" to the god of the mushroom, eleleu, eleleu In the Easter story of the New Testament the same incantatory expression is found, put into the mouth of the Jesus figure, splayed as the mushroom on the cross:</p>
   <p>At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabach— thani!" which means, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"</p>
   <p>And some of the bystanders hearing it said, "Behold he is calling Elijah" (Mark 15 :34f., etc).</p>
   <p>The name "Elijah" is formed of the same elements as the divine name Elohini and the Bacchic cry "eleleu ", ° and was doubtless intended to serve as a clue to the preceding cryptograph. The words, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani", but dubiously mean "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" as every Semiticist knows.5' The "translation" is another of the New Testament "false renderings" of special cultic names or invocations, culled this time from the well-known passage in Psalm 22 :r. The Hebrew here is nowhere rendered by the words "Fbi, Fbi, lama sabachthani" which, on any count, are strange Aramaic. The allusion in the text to the Psalm is but a "cover": lama sabachthani is a clever approximation to the important Sumerian name of the sacred mushroom *LI_4PSh_BA(LA)3...ANTA, source by word-play of so much of the New Testament myth.52 This is the second, or "Aesculapius" part of the incantation Dioscorides says was pronounced by those cutting the "Hellebore". The whole secret invocatory phrase, of which classical tradition brought down only the first part, was a colloquial equivalent of an original Sumerian *E_LA..JJIA, E—LA-UIA, LI-MASh-BA(LA)G-ANTA. Thanks to the Gospel myth-makers and cryptographers we are now able to supply the part the observers of the Bacchic festivals did not, or were not allowed to hear. Another incantatory formula which appears, unusually, on the surface of the New Testament records, and has thereby caused much speculation among the critics and theologians, is the passage in the epistle to the Ephesians:</p>
   <p>Awake, sleeper! Arise from the dead, and the Christ will give you light! (Eph 5:14).</p>
   <p>Calls to "sleepers" to "awaken" are common enough in the Gospel stories, particularly in those dealing with the Agony in the Garden before the Crucifixion (Matt 26 :4off., etc). The interest of this particular incantation is that it is formed from a clever combination of, and word- play on names of the sacred mushroom, and even in its final Greek form is openly related to the necromantic cult from which it is derived. Breaking its code leads us to other important names of the Holy Plant, and to a new understanding of the most famous of all incantations, the Lord's Prayer.</p>
   <p>The cry "Awake, sleeper !" is a word—play on the Aramaic level of the Sumerian phrase * AN...BAR (AB-BA)-NA-IM-A-AN, "canopy of the sky stretched out above", a descriptive epithet of the mushroom. The last part, NA-IM-A-AN, contains the ancient name of the fertility god-hero Adonis, Na'iman.53 A shortened form of the whole phrase gave Hebrew its tribal name "Ephraim", and, following a different dialectal and vocalic development, the patriarchal name, "Abraham", the "father" of Israel.5"</p>
   <p>It is the first element of the name, AN-BAR, found also run together as AB—BA, "father", which has particular interest for us in this study. It means literally, "heaven—stretch", that is, it offers the picture of a sheltering canopy overhead, and so is used of the "father" or "protector" of a family, the Sumerian coming directly into Semitic as 'ab, 'abba', with that meaning. When, for the NA-IM-A-AN ending of the mushroom name above, the alternative Sumerian ending TAB-BA-RI is added, we can at last solve another perplexing little problem concerned with invocations in the New Testament.</p>
   <p>In three places the New Testament writers give us a phrase which is a combination of a foreign word, usually assumed to be Aramaic, and an appended "translation": "Abba, father".55 Now, it is perfectly true that the Greek ho pater, "&amp;ther", accurately represents the Aramaic 'abbj', but one would have thought that this extremely common Semitic word for "father" would have been well enough known even in a Greek-speaking area of the first century not to have necessitated a translation every time it appeared in a text. Since also in each case it appears in the Epistles it is related to the Spirit of God witnessing in the heart of the believer, and in the third instance it is put into the mouth of Jesus in the Garden praying to God (Mark 14:36), there might be in any case reason for regarding it as some incantatory expression of more than ordinary significance.</p>
   <p>When we cry "Abba, father!" it is the Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God (Rom 8:16).</p>
   <p>And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, "Abba, father!" (Gal 4:6).</p>
   <p>The cry, "Abba, (ho) pater!" is simply a play on the Sumerian mushroom phrase *i3...BA_TAB...BA_RI, the b/p and t being transposed.56</p>
   <h3>Daily Bread</h3>
   <p>The invocation of the "Father" reminds us of the opening words of the Lord's Prayer, repeated millions of times a day all over the Christian world. In the mouth of Jesus, the opening words, "My (our) father who art in heaven" is used frequently as a surrogate for God. The very fullness of the phrase has seemed curious where one might have expected a simple "God" or "Father" or the like. The explanation lies in the mushroom title *AB_BA_T_BA_PJ..GI, a rather fuller version of the one cited above and underlying "Abba, father". The cryptographers have teased out the Sumerian into an Aramaic 'abbi' debareqi'a', "0 my (our) father who art in heaven !" Having now penetrated the disguise and laid bare the original Sumerian and the Aramaic phrase made from it, we can now recognize it as a phrase we have all known from our childhood storybooks for a long time: "abracadabra". Originally it had a far more serious intent, and is first found in the writings of one Q. Serenus Sammonicus of the second-third century Al, a physician of the sect we know as Gnostics. This author left precise instructions for the use of this cabbalistic phrase, which was believed to invoke beneficient spirits against disease and mis-, fortune. The magic word had to be stitched in the form of a cross and worn as an amulet in the bosom for nine days, and finally thrown backwards before sunrise into a stream running eastwards. The sect of Gnostics provides one of the major keys to unravelling the mystery of how the mushroom-worshipping Christians became the Church of later times. The Gnostics were groups of ascetics, scorning the lusts of the flesh entirely, and convinced that they possessed a secret and mysterious knowledge denied to lesser mortals, vouchsafed to them by revelation from God. They claimed to be connected to their Saviour-god and the earliest Christians by a secret tradition, and to possess certain mystic writings which only they could interpret. The ultimate object of their faith was an individual salvation, the assurance of a blessed destiny for each soul after death.</p>
   <p>They possessed many such formulae as "abracadabra", and having pride of place above all their secret knowledge were the names of the demons. Only when each soul knew such names and could thus control their power, could repeat the holy formulae and display the right symbol, and were anointed (i.e. "christened") with a holy oil, could he find his way to the seventh heaven, the kingdom of light. Thus, a principal feature of Gnosticism was the transmission to one another in strictest secrecy doctrines about the being, nature, names, and symbols of the Seven Demons or Angels who would otherwise bar their way to achieving the ultimate goal. The movement comes into prominence in the second century Afl and reached its greatest influence in the third quarter of that century, after which it began to wane and was replaced by the closely related and more powerful Manichean movement. However, many of its ideas survived in mystic circles at least into the fourth and fifth centuries.</p>
   <p>What became "orthodox" Christianity waged a war with Gnosticism which it finally won, and the books of the "heresy" were systematically destroyed. Most of what we know about the sect comes from the writings of its ecclesiastical opponents, but of recent years some of their lost books of the later period have been found in the sands of Egypt marvelously preserved, among them the Gospel of Truth.58 We may hope for more and earlier works, but again, we have to remind ourselves that valuable as these lost works would be, the really secret doctrines are unlikely to have been written down in "clear", and the best we can hope for is another cryptic writing like the New Testament. Nevertheless, one fruit of these present researches must be a re—examination of the Gnostic material that has survived for more decipherable abracadabras "Our father who art in heaven," then, is a cryptic way of expressing the name of the Saviour-god, the sacred mushroom. Having broken the code to this extent, it is possible to tackle other outstanding problems in the text. For example, we ask for "daily bread" upon "this day". In point of fact, we have never had a textual justification for doing so, since no one has ever been able to offer a definitive translation for the very rare Greek word epiousion which the text uses to describe the "bread".59 The rendering "daily" is probably the least likely possibility ;60 the marginal reading of RSV, "our bread for the morrow"61 is little better. It is only when we recognize the Sumerian name for the sacred fungus out which the whole "Prayer" has been spun by word- play that we can see just why the cryptographers chose this Greek epithet, and why the other main alternative reading "give us (the bread) that is needful"62 is the correct one. It is an attempt to render the Semitic verb s-p — q, "give what is needful", derived from a word-play on *MAShBA(LA)ANTATAB...BA...RI read as "that-which-is- needful-give — now — bread".63</p>
   <h3>Temptation and preparation for the mysteries</h3>
   <p>Few parts of the Lord's Prayer have given more trouble to the praying Christian and more scope for the exegete than the verse:</p>
   <p>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil (Matt 6:13).</p>
   <p>The Greek word for "temptation", peirasmos, came in for special attention at the time of the decipherment of the Dead Sea Scrolls. It was realized correctly by scholars that behind this New Testament phrase lay the Semitic word for a place for "testing" metals, that is, the refiner's crucible.64 The Essenes in the Scrolls talk of the "time of testing that is coming" using the technical word.65 So, here, in the Prayer, the word-jugglers have taken its Aramaic equivalent, Mr bukhdna", "crucible of testing", out of *LJ..K 11-BA(LA)G-ANTA, the mushroom name. The resultant phrase is particularly interesting because it is almost exactly the Aramaic name of the fungus as it has come down in literature, khurbakhna' or khiirbekhdna' (Arabic kharbaq), attached, like so many mushroom words, to the plant Hellebore.°6</p>
   <p>Taking the sacred fungus, or, in New Testament parlance, "eating the body" of the Christ, must have been a very real peirasmos, "trial", of the body and spirit. It would have seemed no accident to the cultic celebrant that the name of the mushroom and the phrase for "fiery furnace of testing" appeared the same. The customary translation of this powerful concept as "temptation" is almost ridiculous, recalling youthful experiences in the jam-cupboard or behind the woodshed with the girl next door. Well might the writer of Corinthians issue this warning: Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without critically treating his body, eats and drinks a "crisis" upon himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died... (I Cor 11:27—30).</p>
   <p>Isaiah long before had expressed the same warning about the planting of the Adonis (Naiman): "though you make them grow on the day you plant them, and make them blossom in the morning that you sow, yet the harvest will lee away, in a day of grief and incurable pain" (Isa 17:Iof.).</p>
   <p>The Amanita muscaria is, after all, a poisonous fungus. Whilst not the most dangerous, its drugs have, a serious affect on the nervous system, and taken regularly over a long period would in the end kill the addict. Among its drugs so far isolated are Muscarine, Atropine, and Bufotenin.67</p>
   <p>The first causes vomiting and diarrhea, and stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system so that the partaker is capable of great feats of muscular exertion and endurance. The stories which came down of the fantastic strength exhibited by cultic heroes, however mythical the events described, have probably that element of real fact. So, too, the idea that the Maenads in their wild raving devoid of truth.</p>
   <p>Atropine first stimulates the nervous system and then paralyses it. It</p>
   <p>is this poison that is primarily responsible for the hallucinatory effects of</p>
   <p>the sacred fungus, but also for the muscular convulsions that must have seemed to the bystanders like the demons within, wrestling with the newly imbibed power of the god.</p>
   <p>Iifotenin, a secretion otherwise found in the sweat glands of the African toad, lowers the pulse e and temperature. As a result, the mushroom eater has the strange sensation of feeling his skin t and cold simultaneously: hot in some places, cold in others. He finds himself hypersensitive touch, light, and sound. The day following his "trip" he will find all smells seem foul and a bad ite persists in his mouth. He feels an urgent need to urinate but is unable to do so. We are unfortunately denied reports of such clinical observations as these in ancient literature. The initiates of the mushroom cult explained such sensations in terms of demonology. They believed that the god whose flesh they were che wing, or whose blood they were drinking in thei r drugged wine, was actually within their bodies. | t was to be expected that his coming and going would be attended with dreadful physical and mental experiences, and the body needed lengthy preparation for the "trial" by fire. The actual eating of the bitter, burning fungus top, drinking of the laced wine, and perhaps sniffing up of the powdered Agaric-like snuff;68 would be only at the end of days of religious and physical preparation. To obtain some idea of the nature of these preparations and the fearfulness with which they were approached, we may read what Pliny says about the Hellebore. We have earlier noted that many of the mushroom names have come down to us attached to this potent herb, and it is not improbable that what the first-century botanist tells us about the taking of Hellebore similarly reflects traditions which he has picked up concerning the use of the fungus:</p>
   <p>The best white Hellebore is that which most quickly causes sneezing. It is, however, far more terrifying than the black sort, especially if one reads in our old authorities of the elaborate precautions taken, b y those about to drink it, against shivering, choking, overpowering and unseasonable sleep, prolonged hiccough or sneezing, fluxes of the stomach, vomiting, too slow or too long, scanty or too excessive. In fact, they usually gave other things to promote vomiting, and drove out the Hellebore itself by medicine or enema, or often they used even bleeding. Furthermore, even when the Hellebore proves successful (as a purge), the various colours of the vomits are terrifying to see, and after the vomits comes the worry of watching the stools, of superintending the bath, of attention to the whole body, all these troubles being preceded by the great terror caused by its reputation, for it is said that meat, if boiled with it, is consumed.</p>
   <p>It was a fault of the ancient physicians that because of these fears they used to administer this Hellebore in smallish doses, since the larger the dose the quicker it is eliminated. Themison gave doses of not more than two drachmae; his successors actually increased the amount to four, because of the fine testimonial given to Hellebore by Herophilus, who compared it to a truly courageous general; having aroused all within, it itself marches out in the van Care must be taken, even with favourable treatment, not to administer Hellebore on a cloudy day; for to do so is followed by unbearable torture. Indeed, there is no doubt that summer is a better season to give it than winter. For seven days previously the body must be prepared by acid (or, sharp-tasting) foods and by abstinence from wine; on the fourth and third days before, an emetic must be taken, and on the preceding day there should be abstinence from dinner.</p>
   <p>White Hellebore is given even in a sweet medium [the black variety was considered dangerous if its bitter taste was so disguised with a sweet accompaniment that more was taken than the body could tolerate], although most suitably in lentils or pottage. Recently the method has been discovered of splitting radishes, inserting Hellebore, and then pressing the radishes together again, so that the property of the purge penetrates them: the Hellebore is thus administered in a modified form.</p>
   <p>Vomiting begins after four hours, and the whole business is over in seven.... Hellebore is never prescribed for old people or children, or for those who are soft and effeminate in body or mind, or for the thin or delicate. For women it is less suitable than for men, unsuitable too for the nervous or when the hypochondria are ulcerated or swollen, very bad when there is spitting of blood, pain in the side, or sore throat Mixed with pearl barley it kills rats and mice. The Gauls when hunting dip their arrows in Hellebore, and say that the meat, when the flesh around the wound has been cut away, tastes more tender. Flies too die if pounded white Hellebore and milk are sprinkled about. °9 This last use of Hellebore provides an interesting link with Amanita muscaria, or Fly-Agaric, as it is popularly known.</p>
   <p>Linnaeus gave the fungus the Latin name (musca, "fly") precisely because of the age-old practice of killing flies or bugs with it. First attested in medieval times, it is said still to be the practice on the Continent to break up the mushroom into milk to stupefy flies. In Poland and Czechoslovakia a sugar solution is made for that purpose, or sugar sprinkled on the cap.7° Perhaps it is its use to kill vermin like bugs that is meant when Pliny reports of "black Hellebore" that "with it they fumigate and cleanse houses, sprinkling it on sheep, and adding a formal prayer".' So also says Theophrastus: "Men purify horses and sheep with it, at the same time chanting an incantation"72 (presumably one of the special names of the drug). It is this same authority that states that "the white and the black Hellebores appear to have nothing in common except the name".73 One is reminded of the Philistine god Baal-zebub, "Lord of the Flies", whom Ahaziah sought to consult for a prognosis on his health after he had fallen throug h his bedroom window (II Kgs 12ff.). Similarly the Elean g od Muiagros was invoked when a swarm of flies brought plague; the 74 Similarly, sacrifice to the god Myiodes ("Fly-catcher") at the Olympic games, resulted in the mass emigration of flies from the territory.75 One has to remember that in those climes and amid the usual lack of sanitation, flies were more than merely a nuisance. When they "ruined" the land of Egypt as a result of the Pharaoh's intransigence (Exod 8:24), they were a manifestation of the plague-god himself; which is why the Sumerian pest-demon NAM-TAR, Greek Nectar or Mandrake, could kill the pests when all else failed. Thus, to sprinkle "Hellebore" round the house, as Dioscorides says, was thought to preserve it from evil spirits.76</p>
   <p>Pliny thought it strange that Hellebore, "once regarded with horror, should afterwards become so popular that most scholars took it regularly to sharpen their brains for their studies"." It is, perhaps, to the increase in perceptive faculties that the drug of the Amanita muscaria is said to offer, that we should seek for an explanation for Pliny's curious statement that Hellebore should not be given on a "cloudy day; for to do so is followed by unbearable torture. Indeed there is no doubt that summer is a better season to give it than winter". In the story of Lot's visitation by the angels at Sodom, the men of the place, disregarding the traditional laws of Eastern hospitality, threatened to break Lot's doors down unless he would release his visitors to their perverted attentions. Despite Lot's generous offer of his virgin daughters in their stead, the men of Sodom persisted in their efforts to reach the new arrivals, who eventually struck them with a mysterious blindness, "so that they wearied themselves groping for the door" (Gen 19:1—11). It is the same sudden blindness that Yahweh, at Elisha's behest, sends upon the Syrian forces besieging Dothan, and which permitted them to be led away into an ambush (II Kgs 6:18W.). The closest approximation to the unusual Hebrew word for this blindness is found in an Aramaic incantation against a demon who brings about the same condition, described by the Jewish commentators as "dazzling sunlight coming through cracks or breaks in the clouds, being worse than the uncovered sun".78 This sounds like attaeks of migraine, characterized by just such flashes of blinding light and pain behind the eyes. But the names point to meanings more connected with a purge or abortifacient than "blindness" and may reflect another name for the Amanita muscaria. 79</p>
   <p>The increased sensory perceptiveness which is said to be a characteristic of the fungus drug would mean that sudden flashes of light, as shafts of sunlight through clouds, would be highly uncomfortable, if not acutely painful. 80 Perhaps here we have the basis for those stories of the sudden blindness of Sodom and Dothan, and for the revelatory illumination that strikes Paul on the Damascus road (Acts 9:3). The mystic under the influence of the mushroom drug might well believe that the common metaphor that associates inspirational knowledge with light in the darkness had become a reality. The kind of myth as that in which "a sudden light from heaven flashed about Paul... and when his eyes were opened he could see nothing", would seem a natural expression in story form of this mystic experience.</p>
   <p>An interesting facet of Pliny's account of the body's preparation for receiving Hellebore, is the recurrence of the number seven. For seven days previously the belly must be given a special diet of sharp-tasting foods, with an emetic on the fourth and third days and abstinence from dinner on the eve of administering the drug. Then, vomiting will begin after four hours, "and the whole business is over in seven". Elsewhere he says that the life of the mushroom is not more than seven days.81</p>
   <p>Of course, the number seven had a very special potency for ancient philosophers, and particularly, as we saw, for the Gnostics. The whole of creation was divided into seven. The Bible allots seven days for the Creation cycle;82 there were seven lamps on the candlestick in the Temple, representing, so tradition had it, the seven planets.83 The Greeks believed that the whole body was renewed every seven years, and that certain of the seven-year cycles were of special importance, as the age of fourteen when a boy reaches puberty; at twenty-one he attains full sexual maturity; at forty-two a woman reaches her "grand cimacteric", the menopause; at sixty-three men suffer a transitory sexual enfeeblement. The Bible allows mankind but "threescore years and ten" on normal reckoning.84 Nevertheless, the number seven seems particularly connected with the mushroom and the preparatory stages of treatment required by its use as a drug. In Revelation, the mystic speaks of "seven churches of Asia" which he then proceeds very cryptically to describe (Rev i :iiff.). The geographical place-name "Asia" is almost certainly a play on the Semitic word for healing, '— s — y, giving 'asya', "physician",85 still the most likely Semitic source for the sectarian name, "Essenes".86</p>
   <p>With these "seven churches of healing" we may compare two references in the Essene scrolls from the Dead Sea that have recently come to light. In one, the sect is called "the seven divisions of the penitents of Israel".87 The other, unfortunately broken, quotes two biblical passages: the promises of Yaliweli are promises that are pure — silver refined in a furnace... purified seven times (Ps 12:6 [Heb. 7]).</p>
   <p>The stone I have set before Joshua, upon a single stone with seven facets, its inscription is engraved, says Yahweh... (Zech 3:9).</p>
   <p>The broken commentary following these quotations begins, "And I shall heal. »"88 It appears, therefore, that here, as in the New Testament reference, there is a conception of a seven-fold purification, or "healing". The figure of the "refming furnace" in the Psalms quotation is just that of the "temptation" motif of the Scrolls and the New Testament, based as we have seen, verbally and clinically, on the sacred mushroom. In the preparation of body and mind necessary before the participant in the mysteries reaches the climax of the fungus-eating ritual, there must, then, have been seven stages of inward purification.</p>
   <p>The seven degrees of initiation of the widespread religion of Mithras, the Persian sun-god, may serve as an illustration, even if the connection goes no deeper. Since Mithraism was also a mystery religion we know all too little about its doctrines and secrets. But the seven stages of initiation have been left marked in the pattern of the mosaic floors of their meeting-places, and there would appear, from the design, to have been a major break between the first three and the last four stages.89 One is reminded of Pliny's account of the preparation for Hellebore: an emetic has to be taken on the fourth and third days before, as if it were thought that the body at that stage had reached some particular point of crisis.</p>
   <p>In Mithraism, the seven stages are linked with the seven "planets", Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, with the sun and moon. In the New Testament, too, the "seven churches" are consciously identified with the "seven stars":</p>
   <p>As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands [says the visionary mushroom, holder of the keys of Death and the underworld], the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches (Rev 1:20).</p>
   <h3>Substitution and Atonement</h3>
   <p>Christian theology has Jesus as the great atoning sacrifice made by God for mankind. The "Son of God", the image or replica of the divine Father, is sent to earth and sacrificed as an atonement to heal the rift that has opened between God and the world:</p>
   <p>All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled himself to us and gave us the service of reconciliation (exchange) (II Cor 5:18).</p>
   <p>We saw, in an earlier chapter, how the state of imbalance or "sin" brought about when crops were plundered from mother earth, and more especially when the Holy Plant was snatched from her womb, had to be reconciled with compensatory offerings. Only the god himself could satisfactorily atone for this "sacrilege". 00 We noted that the sacred prostitute had to bring to the task of "fascinating" the phallic mushroom "a replica of the thing itself, hanging from her hand", as Josephus says.9'</p>
   <p>A liturgist, around 1400 E in ancient Syria, cried to Baal to send down a compensatory offering for the release of the Mandrake. He calls it, in the Ugaritic consonantal script, '— r — b — d-d, which, thanks to Sumerian, we can now decipher as "Furrow-appeaser" (*URU_]3AD_ BAD), and recognize it in the Greek name of the Holy Plant, Orobadion. The ancient hymn, then, is asking the fertility god to send down the Mandrake's "equivalent" to compensate the ground for its depriva— tjon.92 In the name of the first day of the Anthesteria ceremony, Pithoigia, we may now recognize the same religious activity: compensatory offering as an atonement for the Holy Plant. The Sumerian from which we may now trace the derivation of the Greek word was the phrase GI—DU, "table of offerings", and IGI, "face", that is, "offerings of the presence", the precise equivalent of the</p>
   <p>Hebrew "bread of the presence, or face", the so—called "Shewbread" which was placed before Yahweh in the Temple (Exod 25 :30).93 These "loaves" are simply a further instance of the atoning gifts spoken of by the ancient botanists as "cakes", or "loaves", or "honey—combs" to fill the hole vacated in the ground by the Holy Plant, and more precisely described by Josephus as the Mandrake's "equivalent" necessary for a safe removal of that plant by the Dead Sea. All refer to the mushroom itself by allusion to the characteristic "bun"—shape of the all—important cap containing the drug. When dried and skewered for preservation these fungus "lozenges" were represented by the dehydrated ("massoth") loaves of the "unleavened bread" of the Israelites' Passover food, probably related linguistically if not materially with the mazones of the Dionysiac "cake" feasts.94</p>
   <p>The New Testament relates the expiatory crucifixion of Jesus with the sacrifice of the Passover Lamb of Exodus 12:21: "for Christ, our paschal lamb, has been sacrificed" (I Cor 5:7). The story in the Old Testament which is advanced to explain the origin of this offering of the spring lamb rests in part upon a pun. The name of the animal pesakh95 is fancifully related to the verb pJsakh, "pass over",96 and made to refer to a myth in which the plague demon was induced to avoid the houses of the Israelites when he smote the first-born of Egypt, man and beast. In order to procure this mercy, the people had to sacrifice a lamb for each family and sprinkle its blood on the doorposts and lintels of the houses where it was eaten (Exod 12). The name of the festival derives in fact from another Semitic root p_s — kh, "appease, quieten".97 It signifies that peace which comes after the agony of parturition, when pain is forgotten and the newly born child or animal rests at its mother's side. Cultically, the Pesaklz festival, "Passover", combined gratitude to the fertility deity for the new birth, and a ritualistic attempt to atone for the rape of the womb by a sacrifice of the first-fruits.</p>
   <p>In the Bacchic Anthesteria and in the Christian Easter this "Passover" principle was enshrined in cults and mythology. The Christians saw their Christ, the "anointed" and the "stretched, drawn forth" (the double-play on the root m_sh_kh)98 as the divinely sent substitute offering for the rape of the fungus harvest. He is "raised up" as the "little— cross",99 sacrificed, returns to the earth whence he came, and then resurrected to new life. He is a microcosm of the natural order. He sets the pattern and provides the means whereby celebrants of the mysteries may be "crucified with the Christ" and enter into a mystic experience of a purged and reborn soul, brought afresh from the creative womb of the earth:</p>
   <p>"Truly, truly, I say to you", says Jesus to Nicodemus, "unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God." Nicodemus said to him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be bom?"Jesus answered, "Truly, truly,I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God." (John 3:31f.) Into the story of the betrayal and crucifixion of Jesus, the New Testament cryptographers wove another of their special, "compensatory" names for the sacred fungus. It lies in the incident after the crucifixion when Judas, overcome by remorse for his "betrayal" buys, or has bought on his behalf, a piece of land which is called "the Field of Blood", supposed to represent an Aramaic popular place-name "Akeldama". The story runs as follows:</p>
   <p>When Judas, his betrayer, saw that he was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, saying, "I have sinned in betraying innocent blood." They said, "What is that to us? See to it yourself." And throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed; and he went and hanged himself. But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, "It is not lawful to put them into the Treasury, since they are blood money." So they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood, to this day (Matt 27:3—8).</p>
   <p>A slightly different version of the story adds more enlivening details and ascribes the purchase of the field to Judas himself:</p>
   <p>Now this man bought a field with the reward of his wickedness; and bending over, he burst open in the middle and all his inwards fell out. And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that field was called in their tongue, Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood (Acts i :i8f.).</p>
   <p>Details of the story like the "thirty shekels" and the buying of a field by right of redemption are, of course, borrowed by the story-teller from passages in the Old Testament (Zech 11:12—13; Jer 32:6—IS). Further graphic features like poor Iscariot's losing the contents of his belly owe much to the somewhat earthy, not to say lavatorial humour of the writer, since the sacred fungus, whose name the arch—betrayer bore, was a powerful purge. 100 Far more significant, indeed the point of the whole unlikely tale (why should the temple police need guiding to a spot a few hundred yards away from the city walls and have pointed out to them the person they had been watching for days?), is the title of the "field", Akeldama. We are here given another of the cryptographer's pseudo- translations, reading the word as if it were the Aramaic khaqal demd', "field of blood", whereas what it really represented was the Aramaic 'akal dame', "food of price, or compensation". 101 One can follow the story—teller's line of thought in weaving his tale around the "price" idea, featuring it as the blood-money received by the betrayer Judas, and relating it to the strange passage in Zechariah about the wages paid to "the shepherd of the flock doomed to slaughter". But we can also see now for the first time how such a name as "food of compensation" fits precisely into the pattern of such epithets for the Holy Plant as Orobadion, "furrow appeaser", and the "bread of the presence" of the Jewish temple and the Baccbic Anthesteria.</p>
   <h3>Raising the dead</h3>
   <p>Jn raising the sacred fungus, the participants of the Anthesteria festival were calling up the dead. It is expressly stated by the ancient writers that the Anthesteria was devoted to tending the souls of the departed, and that during the festival the dead were supposed to rise to the upper world. 102 The cult of the sacred mushroom, then, was a manifestation of necromancy, "divination by the dead".</p>
   <p>This extraordinary practice, attested all over the ancient world, lives on in various kinds of spiritualism. The root of the idea is that, since the souls left their bodies and returned to the bowels of the earth, they are in closer touch with the "waters of knowledge", as the subterranean abyss was called. 103 It follows that if one can draw them back in some way they can impart information about the future that is hidden from beings still imprisoned by their fiesl. In the Old Testament we have the story of Saul in desperation for some guidance on future events, Yahweh having deserted his normal oracular devices, consulting a witch who lived at En-Dor (I Sam 28:7—14). At first suspicious of his intentions, since Saul in a burst of pious enthusiasm had earlier banished spiritualist mediums of her kind, the witch was eventually prevailed upon to disturb Samuel at his rest. "What do you see?" asks Saul. "I see God ('Eldhim) coming out of the ground", she replies. "What does he look like?" questions her client. "Like an 'erection' (so the ancient versions)t&gt;04 wearing a robe". Whereupon Saul recognized the dead Samuel's ghost, although for all the comfort that was forthcoming from that somewhat petulant source, he might have saved himself the trouble of his visit.</p>
   <p>This connection between the sacred fungus and the omniscient souls of the dead leads to its names being often connected with demons of death. Thus the Sumerian NAM-TAR, which came into Greek as Nektar, our nectar, is used generally for "plague demon", and the Old Testament Liith, the so-called "night-hag" which Isaiah threatens will haunt a desolate Edom (34:14) is probably an original mushroom word. 105</p>
   <p>In the New Testament rare reference is made to a festival called the Agape, so-called Love Feast (Jude v.12; II Pet 2 :13(?)). The Syriac translators, at any rate,.thought the practice had to do with the comforting of the dead,'°6 and this certainly accords well with the meaning of agapad, "love". This Greek word, so favoured by the New Testament writers, is used by the tragedians for affection for the dead, and specifically in the Bible for the relationship between man and God.'07 It is properly used in the Greek version of the Old Testament to translate a Hebrew word for "seduce, allure".'°8 Its Sumerian original AG- AG means "love", and also "stretch, measure", semantically the equal of the Semitic m-sh-kh, "draw out". A cognate verb in Greek is ago, "lead; bring up, draw out, etc" used in such words as nekragogos, "leading forth the dead", psukhagogeo, "conjure up souls from the nether world", and so on.</p>
   <p>The Agape seems to have involved a common meal of some kind, although New Testament references are too cryptic to tell us much, and post-biblical accounts of the Agape, as of most other aspects of the real nature of Christianity and its rites, too unreliable. If as one suspects, the Agape is in fact another name for the fungus itself, then the feast will have included the eating of the mushroom's flesh and drinking of its juice, in other words, it will have been identical with the "Lord's Supper", the eating of the raised or "crucified" Christ: I have been crucified with (erected with) Christ; I live, yet it is no longer I, but Christ lives in me (Gal 2:20).</p>
   <p>Thereafter the celebrant possesses the mystic "knowledge of God", so earnestly desired by the followers of the mysteries:</p>
   <p>I bow my knees before the Father... that he may grant you to be strengthened with might through his Spirit in the inner man, and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you... may have power to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fuiness of God (Eph 3 14— '9).</p>
   <p>Isaiah also looked for the manifestation of the spirits of the dead. He identified them with the "giants" of old, the Rephaim whose gift of knowledge to mankind had proved a not unmixed blessing:</p>
   <p>Thy dead shall live, their bodies shall rise. o dwellers in the dust, awake and sing forjoy! For thy dew is a dew of light, and on the land of the Shades (Rephaim) thou wilt let it fall (Isa 26:19).</p>
   <p>We noticed this passage previously when discussing the mushroom as the "Morning Star", germinated by the dew that fell from Venus before the dawn.'°9 It was pointed out there that the Rephaim were those "cast down from heaven", identified with the fallen angels of Genesis and Jewish mythology. According to the Bible, these "sons of God" were seduced by the beauty of mortal women and begot a race of supermen (Gen 6: if.). Later Jewish tradition has it that their seduction was at least partly their own fault since they had taught the girls the art of cosmetics, and so had begun the awful progress of mankind to degeneracy and sexual abandon. More important, "they taught them charms and enchantments, the cutting of roots, and made them acquainted with plants..." (Enoch : iff).</p>
   <p>To raise these dormant spirits of the dead was the way to enlightenment. However, the noises produced by those through whom the spirits spoke were not necessarily intelligible. Isaiah speaks of such necromancers or ventriloquists ("belly—speakers") scornfully as "chirping and muttering" when they seek by oracle their god through "the dead, on behalf of the living" (8:19). In the New Testament it is called "speaking with tongues". Thus the faithful are encouraged to "pursue love (agape), be zealous for spiritual gifts, especially that you might prophesy. For one speaking in a tongue speaks not to man but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit... He who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be edified... If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is played? So with yourselves; if you in a tongue utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air... Therefore, he who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret... tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is not for Un- believers but for believers. If, therefore, the whole church assembles and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say you are mad?..." (I Cor 14:1—23); which was perhaps better than accusing them, like the apostles at Pentecost of being "filled with new wine" (Acts 2:13).</p>
   <p>Looking back over the discussion of this chapter, we can see how the worship cf the mushroom encompassed every aspect of the processes of nature. When modem religious practice seems at times removed from reality, a Saturday or Sunday relaxation, even entertainment, rather than a concerted effort to influence the deity or be influenced by him, it is worth reminding ourselves that for the ancients it was a life—or—death matter. If the god did not respond to their pleas for rain or sunshine, they, their children, and their crops and animals died.</p>
   <p>When, before their eyes, the greenness of the ground vanished under the wilting heat of the summer sun, the dwellers of Near Eastern lands then, as now, viewed the future apprehensively. Everything depended on the god's bounty in the Autumn and the following Spring. The enemy, in their mythological terms, had killed the fertility hero; would the New Year see his resurrection? In the little mushroom, men could see a prime example of the transience of nature's gifts: in the morning it appeared, and by nightfall the worms had consumed it. The god himself had been among them; they sought him and apprehended him, but his manifestation was a temporary thing. For one ileeting moment he fulfilled his promise that those who received him could become the "children of God".</p>
   <p>The worshipper could not approach the god empty-handed. He must bring with him a gift, itself god-given, as an atonement to the earth. Only thus, and by calling simultaneously upon the god by name, could he withstand the demonic power of the fungus. For to eat the god was to die with him; in the short hours of the initiate's complete communion with the deity he had "died" to the world. It was then that he was at most fearful risk, and the days of careful preparation for the ultimate mystery were given their most crucial testing. This was the time of "trial" or "temptation" through which every participant in the cult passed.</p>
   <p>To raise the sacred fungus was to raise the spirits of the dead, and thus to communicate with the source of subterranean knowledge. This we may now identify with the Bacchic Anthesteria and possibly the Church's Agape feast, the "drawing up" of the phallic mushroom. Very much earlier than the documentary recording of either of these cultic practices is the raising of the fungus in the so-called "gardens of Adonis". For long this mystic practice has remained obscure in its details, although there has been little doubt that it had to do with the lamenting and raising of the dead god, and thus presumed to be connected with an agricultural cult. For the first time we can decipher the names involved and are thus able to draw together a number of other references to the mushroom religion and those who partook in its rites.</p>
   
   <h2>XVIII. The Garden of Adonis, Eden and Delight; Zealots and Muslims</h2>
   <p>The most explicit reference to the lamenting for the fertility deity in the Old Testament is found in the account of the prophet Ezekiel's vision of the Temple. In a psychedelic trance he fancied himself being carried hundreds of miles from Mesopotamia to Jerusalem: Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of Yahweh; and behold, there sat women bewailing Tammuz. Then he said to me, "Have you seen this, 0 son of man? You will see still greater abominations than these" (Ezek 8 :i4f.).</p>
   <p>Jerome translates Tammuz here as Adonis, 1 quite properly, since the Mesopotamian hero-deity was but another representation of the Semitic and Greek Adonis, known and worshipped, particularly by women, all over the ancient Near East. Jerome also records that in Bethlehem of his time (fourth—fifth century) there was still a grove connected with Adonis.2 It was the practice in the so-called "gardens of Adonis" for women to gather round pots in which certain seedlings had been shallowly planted and to try and urge their germination by various means, including loud lamentation for the dead god. The heat of the sun and the method of planting and fertilization seem to have had a seemingly magical effect, but under the circumstances of their propagation the shoots soon withered away. Whatever the plants were that the women later chose for their agricultural ritual,3 a kind of sympathetic magic to promote the growth of the crops, the origin of the cult is clearly seen in the search for the sacred mushroom in the "holy mountains" of the north.</p>
   <p>The transient nature of the "gardens of Adonis" is exemplified in the rapid growth and as speedy disappearance of the mushroom. Jonah's "sunshade" fungus was eaten by worms the day after it appeared: "it came into being in a night and perished in a night" (Jonah 3 :io). A modern observer of the Amanita muscaria detected its first appearance at 8 a.m. and by 4 p.m. the same day the fungus was fully grown and beginning to rot.4 The Phalloidic species, like the Stink-horn, Phallus impudicus, rises some three inches in half an hour, and the whole erection is complete in one and a half hours.5 Isaiah comments on the same feature of the "Adonis plant" when he speaks of the cultic practice thus:</p>
   <p>For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not remembered the Rock of your refuge; therefore, though you plant the plantings of Na'iman (RSV: "pleasant plants"), and sow the sacred mushroom (RSV:</p>
   <p>"set out ships of an alien god"), though you make them grow on the day that you plant them, and make them blossom in the morning that you sow; yet the harvest will flee away in a day of grief and incurable pain (Isa 17:Iof.).8</p>
   <p>The names Adonis and Na'iman given to the god, known in Mesopotamia as Tammuz ("Son of Life"),7 have much the same meaning as we saw earlier. Adonis comes probably from a Sumerian phrase *A]&gt;J1)JTAN, "heavenly shade", so that the use of the name in the Bible as a divine epithet and ordinary noun meaning simply "lord", implies the "protective, overshadowing" function of lordship.8 Similarly, Na'iman, derives from a Sumerian *NA_..A_AN, "stretched across the heavens",9 so that both Adonis and Na'iman can have a particular botanical reference to the cap of the mushroom.</p>
   <p>This new tracing of the names of Adonis/Na'iman to their source enables us to discover the origin of the phrase "gardens of Adonis", as used by the ancient writers. It also points to the origin of the "Garden of Eden" story and its mushroom connections. We can even look on much further in time and for the first time uncover the source and nature of the name and associations of those warlike patriots of the Jewish world, the first-century "Zealots", as they were called. First, the "garden" motif that is so prevalent in the mushroom culture and mythology. It derives from a misunderstanding (or fanciful interpretation) of a Sumerian word, GAN. This has two general meanings:</p>
   <p>First, an "enclosed area", a "field", or a "garden", and it is with this significance that it came on down into the Semitic world as gan. Second, GAN meant the "canopy" top of the mushroom, or anything of similar rounded shape. 10 Prefaced to NA-IM-A—AN, "stretched across the heavens", it would have the latter connotation, "arched canopy, stretched across the heavens", a description of the cap of the mushroom, writ large, as it were. However, brought down as a name of the sacred fungus into Semitic, as gan-Na'iman, it would have been read as "garden of Na'iman, Adonis". In other words, what the botanists understood as a "grove" or "garden" dedicated to the god, was, in fact, just a name of the mushroom itself.</p>
   <p>Mushroom names came to be used to express generally the idea of "good living, luxuriousness". In Semitic, Na'iman developed a root meaning "be sweet, pleasant, delightful".!' Thus the phrase "gan-Na'— iman" came to be understood not only as "the garden of Adonis/ Na'iman" but also as "the garden of delight". Hebrew's equivalent noun for this kind of luxuriating is 'eden, and so was born the name of the homeland of our first parents, the "Garden of Eden."2 In the Muslim Scriptures, the Qur'an, Paradise is given the more original form, "gan—Na'iman", in Arabic gannati — una 'imi. '3</p>
   <p>In short, the biblical Garden of Eden, the Qur'anic "gardens of delight", the "Tammuz" whom the women bewailed at the Temple gate, and the Na'iman plants that Isaiah said would flee away in grief are all probably to be identified with the sacred mushroom. The Zealots</p>
   <p>We may now look to the "Zealots" who caused such upheaval and disaster in Jewish history. The Sumerian word just referred to, GAN, as well as meaning the cap of the red-topped mushroom, came also to signify the colour "red" and to be used of the red dye cochineal. 14 Among Semitic words derived from this root was one, qanna', "be red in the face", and so implying a pent-up emotion like jealousy, zeal, eager rivalry, and the like. 15 It is thus used of God, as jealous of his honour, and of men as "zealous", or, as we might say, as displaying a hot-headed emotion, letting their hearts rule their heads. Josephus speaks of the Maccabean rebels of the second pre-Christian century as "zealous for their country's laws and the worship of God".'6 In this he speaks with obvious approval. But he uses the same adjective as a proper name or title of another group of rebels of the first century AD who formed the hard core of the Jewish rebellion against Rome and which was to destroy the Temple and drive the Jewish people of Palestine to swell the ranks of the Dispersion. Josephus has little love for these "Zealots" (Greek Zeidtai): "for so these miscreants called themselves, as though they were zealous in the cause of virtue and not for vice in its basest and most extravagant form". '7 This may not have been entirely fair, but certainly their actions brought death to thousands of innocent people. Believing themselves possessed of some special power and knowledge, the Zealots provoked a revolt throughout Palestine which brought down on Jews everywhere the might of Rome.</p>
   <p>The Romans were ever tolerant of other people's religions or superstitions but they could under no circumstances allow political to take hold within the empire, on however cini a religious pretext. This was particularly the case with Palestine, which always was and still is the world's storm-centre of political and religious emotions. When the Zealot revolt began in Caesarea in An 66, the Romans moved quickly and ruthlessly against the rebels, driving them south and finally besieging them in Jerusalem. In AD 70, the Temple itself was destroyed, and three years later the last rebel stronghold at Masada by the Dead Sea was reduced.</p>
   <p>In the details of this bloody and quite unnecessary war, Josephus, although he grew to hate the Zealots, on whose side he had once fought, cannot refrain from expressing a grudging admiration for their almost inhuman disregard for their personal safety, and for the way in which they would willingly expose themselves and their families to certain death rather than submit to the enemies of their god. He tells us in the most moving terms, of the events that led, in May, AD 73, to the final collapse of the revolt and the death of the last survivors. Nearly a thousand men, women and children, facing almost certain annihilation at the hands of the Romans besieging Masada, decided to commit suicide rather than fall into the power of the enemy. They chose ten men from the rest by ballot. These cut the throats of their comrades and their families, and, having chosen one of their number, submitted their own throats to his knife. When the gruesome deeds were done, and amidst the smoking remains of their last stores and the blood of his fellow Jews, this last Zealot plunged his sword into his own heart.'8 Recent archaeological excavations at the great fortress site have added some measure of conformation to the story,' 0 embroidered though it certainly is by the Jewish historian's sense of drama.
