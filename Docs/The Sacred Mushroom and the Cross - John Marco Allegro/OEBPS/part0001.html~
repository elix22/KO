   <p>The Greek Korkoron, the "Christ" mushroom, appears also as an alternative name for Halicacabus,28 another of the "bolt" designations of the fungus. Its name is related to the Semitic word for "star" envisaged as a penis in the sky, a miniature "sun". Our own word "star" comes via Greek from a Sumerian word for "knobbed bolt". Of Halicacabus, Pliny says:</p>
   <p>The root of Halicacaks is taken in drink by those who, to confirm superstitious notions, wish to splay the inspired prophet, and to be seen publicly raving in unpretended madness.</p>
   <p>He adds that the root is "so antipathetic to the nature of asps, that if it be brought near to the reptile it stupifies that very power of theirs to kill by stupefaction".</p>
   <p>Allusions like this to serpents and antidotes for their poisons or malign influences over the mind, usually imply some special relationship between the plant and the reptile. Mushrooms and serpents are closely related in folk—lore, and in this case we are reminded of the Old Testament passage about Moses' brazen serpent, on which Jesus models himself,3° that anyone "bitten by a snake might look on it and live" (Num 21:9).</p>
   <p>Of the other Sumerian elements that went to make up mushroom names, RI, or dialectal LI, also meant "cone"— or "bun"—shape, MASh (-TAB-BA), "twin", so LI-MASh meant "two cones" or "hemispheres", like, MASh-TAB-BA-R/LI. The word GI means "stem" so that LI-LI-GI could describe the mushroom as two halves of the volva separated by the erect stem.3' Very common in the phallic nomenclature of the mushroom is the Sumerian BALAG, "crown of the penis; glans". Supplemented by ANTA, "raised", we shall meet the word in the name given to the Maenads, Bacchantes, and the Hebrew "weepers" for Tammuz.32 In Sumerian, the orgiasts whose task it was to cause the erection of the male organ, and in the cult, the raising of the phallic mushroom, were called BALAG-NAR. By natural association of ideas this combined word came into Greek as the name for an axe-handle, pelekunarion, which was pushed through the central hole of the double- axe head, the peleL'us.33</p>
   <p>The extension of "erect penis" words to stakes, rods, cudgels, and the like is common in any language. Of the BALAG-derived words we might cite the Greek plialagx, Latin and our phalanx, meaning a "roller, log, or rank of soldiers".4 Another onion name, referring to the "knobbed root" of the vegetable that provoked phallic allusions, was the Latin pallacana, precisely our Sumerian *BALAG...AN(TA).35 The ancient naturalists speak of a poisonous spider whose name Phalaggion stems from the same root. Its connections with the genital organ are clear from their descriptions of the effects of its bite:</p>
   <p>The eyes become bloodshot, a shivering settles upon his limbs, and straight- way his skin and genitals grow taut, his penis projects, dripping with foul ooze. • 36 Among the antidotes for this fearsome poison is listed Asparagus, a well-known antaphrodisiac, and also named from the Sumerian BALAG, presumably on account of its straight stalk.37</p>
   <p>Semitic made a number of roots from BALAG, "crown of the penis", and found therein words denoting a hemispherical or "bun" shape, as those for a young woman's firm breast, the similarly shaped whorl of a spindle, half a pomegranate skin, a human temple, and a cake of figs.38 As in the title "Bacchante", the middle "L" of BALAG became assimilated to the following consonant in pronunciation, giving sounds like "bacc-" or (from the cognate BULUG) "bucc-". Latin thus gained its bucca, "cheek", and Hebrew one of its names for the mushroom, paqqu'ah.39 From the New Testament myth-maker's point of view, this double pronunciation greatly enlarged his scope for punning. He could use</p>
   <p>BALAG in full for Semitic roots like p-l-kh, "make"4° ("On this rock I will build (make) my church"), but could shorten it and run into the preceding MASh of the fungus name, finding roots like sh-b-kh, "bless, praise" ( "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar—jonah..."),41 and sh — b — q, "release, forgive" ("whatsoever you release on earth..."),42 and so on.</p>
   <p>Having seen something of how the New Testament writers use the old sacred names of the mushroom for their word-play, we have now to look again at the nature of the fungus itself. From the manner of its growth and its sexual resemblances come many of the "human" allusions in the stories that grew up round it. Its main parts, the "volva" and the "penis" stem, represented the essential distinguishing features of men and women, and in mythology they served as symbols for the male and female characters in the stories.</p>
   
   <h2>VII. The Man-child Born of a Virgin</h2>
   <p>Describing the growth of the mushroom ( boletos) , Pliny says: "the earth produces first a 'womb' (vulva)... and afterwards (the mushroom) itself inside the womb, like a yolk inside the egg; and the baby mushroom is just as fond of eating its coat as is the chicken. The coat cracks when (the mushroom) first forms; presently, as it gets bigger, the coat is absorbed into the body of the footstalk (pediculi)... at first it is flimsier than froth, then it grows substantial like parchment, and then the mushroom. • is born. 1</p>
   <p>More prosaically, perhaps, the process is thus described by a modern mycologist: "In the genus Amanita a membrane surrounds the young fungus. In addition to this wrapper or volva there is another membrane, stretching from the margin of the cap and joined to the stem, as in the mushroom. Thus it is as if the "button stage" were surrounded by an outer skin. As the fungus develops this is torn apart. If its texture is sufficiently tenacious to hold it together, it is left as a cup at the base of the stem... With growth the membrane covering the gills tears and is left as a ring on the stem." Of the Amanita phalloides, the writer adds:</p>
   <p>"Before the volva breaks the fungus looks somewhat like a pigeon's egg half-buried, or like a small phallus 'egg'. It is common in glades in woods and adjoining pastures after the first summer rains, and continues through early autumn."2</p>
   <p>It was the fertilization of the "womb" that most puzzled the ancients, and remained a mystery until the end of the last century. To Pliny the fungus had to be reckoned as one of the "greatest of the marvels of nature", since it "belonged to a class of things that spring up spontaneously and cannot be grown from seed".3 It was surely "among the most wonderful of all things" in that it could "spring up and live without a root".4 Until the invention of the microscope the function of the spore, produced by each fungus in its millions, could not be appreciated. The mushroom has, indeed, no seed in the accepted sense, germinating and giving out a root and later a stem apex with or without seed leaves. The walls of each minute spore extrude to form thread-like tubes which branch further until all mass together to form the spongy flesh of the fungus. The result is neither animal nor vegetable, and the mystery of its proper classification persisted until relatively modern times. Thus a sixteenth-century naturalist wrote: "They are a sort of intermediate existence between plants and inanimate nature. In this respect fungi resemble zoophytes, which are intermediate between plants and animals."5</p>
   <p>One explanation for the creation of the mushroom without apparent seed was that the "womb" had been fertilized by thunder, since it was commonly observed that the fungi appeared after thunderstorms. Thus one name given them was Ceraunion, from the Greek keraunios, "thunderbolt". Another was the Greek hudnon, probably derived from Sumerian *UD_NUN, "storm—seeded".6</p>
   <p>It was thus uniquely-begotten. The normal process of fructification had been by-passed. The seed had not fallen from some previous plant, to be nurtured by the earth until in turn it produced a root and stalk. The god had "spoken" and his creative "word" had been carried to earth by the storm-wind, angelic messenger of heaven, and been implanted directly into the volva. The baby that resulted from this divine union was thus the "Son of God", more truly representative of its heavenly father than any other form of plant or animal life. Here, in the tiny mushroom, was God manifest, the "Jesus" born of the Virgin "the image of the invisible God, the first-born of all creation •. in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell..." (Col i :isff.). The phallic form of the mushroom matched precisely that of his father, whom the Sumerians called ISKUR, "Mighty Penis", the Se— mites Adad, or Hadad, "Big—father", the Greeks Pater-Zeus, and the Romans Jupiter, "Father-god".7 To see the mushroom was to see the Father, as in Jesus the uncomprehending Philip was urged to look for God: "He who has seen me has seen the Father... Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father in me?" (John i4:9ff.). Even the detutns recognized him as "the Holy One of God" (Mark i :24), and it was as "the Holy Plant" that the sacred fungus came to be known throughout the ancient world.</p>
   <p>The slimy juice of the mushroom which, in some phalloidic species, spills over the "glans" and clown the stem, seemed to the ancients like the viscous exudation of the genital organs prior to coitus and the seminal discharge at orgasm. The Hebrew word for "smooth, slimy" derives from a Sumerian phrase meaning "semen running to waste",8 and figures in a number of biblical allusions to the mushroom.9 It was otherwise known as "spittle", and Job asks if there is any taste in the "spittle of the mushroom" (as we should now read the name of that plant) (Job 6:6). 10 To have "spittle in the mouth" was a euphemism in the Jewish Talmud for "semen in the vagina", 11 and the close relationship between the two fluids resulted in the very widespread belief that spittle had strong curative and prophylactic properties. Thus, as human semen was a cure for scorpion stings, according to Pliny,-2 spittle was a repellent to snakes and an antidote to snake venom. 13 Jesus is pictured making a clay poultice to lay over the eyes of the man born blind (John 9:6), mixing his spittle with dust, as Pliny reports that saliva used each morning as an eye ointment cured ophthalmia.'4</p>
   <p>Rain, the semen of the god, was spurted forth from the divine penis at his thunderous orgasm in the heavens, and was borne as "spittle" from the lips of the glans to earth on the storm wind. 15 It was a unique concentration of this powerful spermatozoa in the juice of the "Holy Plant" that the Magi believed would give anyone anointed with it amazing power. They could "obtain every wish, banish fevers, and cure all diseases without exception". 16 So the Christian, the "smeared or anointed one", received "knowledge of all things" by his "anointing from the Holy One" (I John 2:20). Thereafter he had need of no other teacher and remained for evermore endowed with all knowledge (v. 27). Whatever the full ingredients of the Christian unction may have been, they would certainly have included the aromatic gums and spices of the traditional Israelite anointing oil: myrrh, aromatic cane, cinnamon, and cassia, all representing the powerful semen of the god. Under certain enclosed conditions, a mixture of these substances rubbed on the skin could produce the kind of intoxicating belief in self-omniscience referred to in the New Testament. Furthermore, the atmosphere of the oracular chamber would be charged with reek of sacred incense consisting of "sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum, sweet spices with pure frankincense..." (Exod 30:34), giving the kind of overpowering hypnotic effect referred to by an early Christian writer when he speaks of "the frenzy of a lying soothsayer" as a "mere intoxication produced by the reeking fumes of sacrifice". 17</p>
   <p>That these ingredients formed only part of the sacred incense formula is well known. Josephus says there were thirteen elements, 18 and the Talmud names eleven, plus salt, and a secret "herb" which was added to make the smoke rise in a vertical column before spreading outwards at the top. 19 With the characteristic shape of the mushroom in mind, we can hazard a fair guess now at this secret ingredient.</p>
   <p>Knowledge and healing were two aspects of the same life-force. If to be rubbed with the "Holy Plant" was to receive divine knowledge, it was also to be cured of every sickness. James suggests that anyone of the Christian community who was sick should call the elders to anoint him with oil in the name of Jesus (Jas 5:14). The Twelve are sent out among their fellow-men casting out demons and anointing the sick with oil (Mark 6:13). Healing by unction persisted in the Church until the twelfth century,2° and the anointing of the dying, the so-called "extreme unction" has persisted in the Roman Catholic Church to this day.21 The principle behind this practice remains the same: the god's "seed—of— life", semen, found in spring or rain water, in the sap or resins of plants and trees, and above all in the slimy mucus of the mushroom imparts life to the ailing or the dead..</p>
   <p>Herein lies also the idea of embalming corpses with ointments and spices. They were not expected to halt decomposition, as Martha appreciated in the case of her four-day dead brother Lazarus (John 11:39), although in Egypt additional measures were taken also to preserve even the flesh. The Hebrew of the story of Joseph's embalming for forty days uses the word "healers"22 for the practitioners of the craft (Gen 50:2), and the word for "embalm" means also "to come filly to life, mature", as well as "make spicy".23 The root goes back to Sumerian words for "spilling seed", and the conception seems to have been to impart life and rebirth to the dead person in the underworld. So the two Marys come to the grave to anoint the dead Jesus (Mark 16:1; Luke 23:56) as did Nicodemus, bringing myrrh and aloes for the purpose (John 19:39), and as Mary, Martha's sister, had earlier anointed his feet with nard, anticipating the event (John 12:3). Things, as well as people, could be anointed with semen so that they became "holy", that is, separated to the god's service. The Semitic root q-d-sh, "holy", is, as its probable root meaning indicates, fundamentally a fertility word. It has to do specifically with the uterus,24 the "holy of holies" of the female, and the inner sanctuary of the temple. So the cultic furniture was anointed (Exod 3:26, 40:10 Lev 8:ii), and particularly the altar, that replica of the penis standing before the open portals of the temple. In the story of Jacob and his ladder dream, when he saw angels going up and down between earth and heaven, he took the stone on which he had laid his head in sleep and erected it as a pillar and "poured oil on the top of it" (Gen 28:10W, cp. Gen 35:14).25 The anointing into holiness of kings and priests is again largely imitative in character. The prime duty of the king was to ensure the fertility of the land and well-being of his subjects. Many of the Greek and Semitic words for "lord" and "lordship" convey this idea when seen in their original form.26 The priest's function was also to see that the god played his part in inseminating the land. The most common Hebrew word for "priest", kohen, familiar as a well-known Jewish surname, comes from a Sumerian title, GU-EN-NA, literally, "guardian of semen".27 He had charge of the god's house, regarded as the uterus where he enacted his role of creator.28 Pouring the god's semen over the heads of these dignitaries was intended to represent them as "gods", replicas of the divine penis in heaven.29</p>
   
   <p>3 Section through the calyx and fruit of Henbane (after F. Howarth, in Josephus, Jewish Antiquities [Loeb, iv] p. 399)</p>

   <p>The head-gear of the Jewish high priest, called simply a "turban" in the Old Testament (Exod 28:4, etc), was apparently intended to represent the glans penis. Josephus has an extended account of this piece of ceremonial attire.30 He describes it by alluding to several different plants, all of them having a mushroom relevance. One, indeed, Sideritis, actually is a name of the Holy Plant.31 First, the priest dons a skull—cap (Greek pilos, Latin pileus, incidentally, the botanist's name for the cap of the mushroom), as worn by the generality of the priesthood. Over this he puts a turban of violet embroidery, further encircled with a crown of gold. Sprouting from the top of this was a golden calyx, or seed—vessel. In order to satisfy the curiosity of his remarkably ill-informed readers, Josephus goes on to describe in great detail the nature and shape of the calyx, "for those unfamiliar with it" , comparing it with that of Henbane, Hyoscyamus niger (fig. 3 ). "Imagine", says our ingenious author, "a ball cut into two: the calyx at the stem presents the lower half of this, emerging from its base in a rounded form." He then enlarges on the graceful turn of the sides to the "rim" on to which the "hemispherical lid adheres closely". This calyx, he says, is enveloped in a husk or sheath which detaches itself of its own accord as the fruit begins to develop. This is not a very accurate account of the Henbane calyx and its ovary, but it well suits the volva of the Boletus mushroom as the embryo begins to expand. Josephus speaks further of the ragged edge of the lip of the calyx, "like thorns quite sharp at the end". This is presumably an allusion to the three— tiered golden crown surrounding the violet turban,82 and in human terms to the edge of the circumcised foreskin. The Bible makes no mention of a golden crown, but it does speak of a "plate of gold" (sis), affixed to the front of the priest's turban (Exod 28 :36).33 As Josephus was well aware, the word sis is used in late Hebrew for the fringe of shreds of the prepuce remaining after an insufficient circumcision operation, a kind of "crown of thorns" around the bared glans.34 In mushroom terms, this "fringe" will be the membrane that joins the margin of the pileus cap to the stem before its full development. When the skin breaks it remains as a ragged ring around the stem.</p>
   <p>New Testament imagery has Jesus crowned with thorns and clothed with royal purple (John 19:2). The deep red cap of the sacred mushroom added to its phallic significance in the eyes of the ancients and provided them with words for that colour, as will be noted. These "glans-crowned" officials, kings and priests, were then, the messiahs, or christs, said in the 01 Testament to be "smeared with Yahweh" (I Sam 26:11; Ps 2:2), "having the consecration, or crown of God's unction upon them" (Lev 21:12). In that holy condition they were not allowed to leave the sanctuary precincts (Lev 21:12; cp. 10:7), unless by some ill chance and erotic dream, they were to spoil their ritual purity by inadvertently mixing their own semen on their bodies with that of the god. In that case they were obliged to leave the sacred area of the Jerusalem temple by an underground passage leading to the profane area of the city.35</p>
   <p>Both the Semitic and the Greek words for "christ", the "anointed, or smeared one", came from Sumerian terms for semen or resinous saps, MASh and SKEM. Used as descriptive titles in that language, they appear as a "MASh—man", exorcist, that is, the priest who drives away demons, and as a "ShEM-man" a compounder of perfumes, the equivalent of the Old Testament mixer of the holy anointing-oils.36</p>
   <p>Semitic furthermore combined both Sumerian words into a new root sh — m — sh, "serve" (tables, as a steward; the temple, as a priest; the heavenly throne, as an angel; the genitals, as a penis or a vulva). Thus the noun means a steward, priest, angel or prostitute.37 An independently derived form very early on came to be used for the greatest "copulator" of all, the sun, Hebrew shemesh, whose fiery glans every evening plunged glowing into the open vulva of the earth, and in the morning "came forth like a bridegroom from his marriage chamber" (Ps 19:5).38 Another important word for a servitor of god in Greek was therapeutes, the verb therapeuo implying both service to god and attendance on the body as physicians, in which sense we have derived our "therapy", "therapeutics", and the like. This root also has a sexual origin, as a "giver of life", and is connected with the Sumerian DARA, "beget", appearing as a name for the fertility and storm gods Ea and Adad.39</p>
   <p>The word therapeutes is of particular interest since it was the title of an ascetic, contemplative sect who have often been compared with the Essenes. They lived mainly in Egypt, at the turn of the era, but probably had a long history prior to that date. We know of them through the writings of the first-century Philo,4° and Eusebius, the Church historian (third and fourth century) »41 The Therapeutae, as they are called, lived in mixed communities, cut off from their fellow-men, rejecting personal property, completely celibate, the women being mostly "aged virgins... who have kept their chastity of their own free will in their ardent desire for learning". They all met together only on the Sabbath, the women being separated from the men by a dividing partition in the assembly hail. But every seventh week after supper, both sexes mingled, singing and dancing until dawn, when they returned to their own quarters. Eusebius was so struck by the likeness of the Therapeutae to Christian monks of his own day that he thought they may have been Christians, and that the books referred to by Philo as "the writings of ancient men who were the founders of the sect" may have been the Gospels and Epistles through which they had become converted. The Church Fathers followed him on this and even Jerome reckoned the Jewish Philo as among the "Church historians".</p>
   <p>We hear, too, of an unorthodox Christian sect called the Sampsaeans (Greek Sampsenoi), whose name is certainly connected with the Semitic root sh-m — sh (and so has been hitherto thought to indicate "sun (shemesh)-worshippers").42 Epiphanius, the fourth-century Christian writer, links these people with the Essenes but thought their Christianity was of a spurious kind, something between Judaism and the true faith.48 Apparently in his time they dwelt in Transjordan, in Peraea, on the borders of ancient Moab, and by the eastern shores of the Dead Sea. Whatever their sectarian connections, their name, as we can now see, demonstrates a clear philological relationship with both the Essenes, "healers", "life—givers", the Therapeutae, and the Christians.</p>
   <p>In the phallic mushroom, the "man-child" born of the "virgin" womb, we have the reality behind the Christ figure of the New Testament story. In a sense he is representative also of the initiates of the cult, "Christians", or "smeared with semen", as the name means. By imitating the mushroom, as well as by eating it and sucking its juice, or "blood", the Christian was taking unto himself the panoply of his god, as the priests in the sanctuary also anointed themselves with the god's spermatozoa found in the juices and resins of special plants and trees. As the priests "served" the god in the temple, the symbolic womb of divine creation, so the Christians and their cultic associates worshipped their god and mystically involved themselves in the creative process. In the language of the mystery cults they sought to be "born again", when, purged afresh of past sin, they could apprehend the god in a drug induced ecstasy.</p>
   <p>Fully to understand the part played by women in the mushroom cult it is necessary to appreciate their role in the creative process itself. The fungus represented a microcosm of the female part of the birth cycle. The "man—child" was born from a womb or volva and its gestation and parturition was as much a part of the female worshipper as the birth of a human baby required the active participation of the mother and the midwife. In the following chapters, then, we shall pay special attention to the woman and her special contribution to the process of conception and birth, her religious role as a cultic prostitute, and the part played by her ritual lamentation in the raising of the sacred mushroom.</p>
   
   <h2>VIII. Woman's part in the Creative Process</h2>
   <p>Gestation of the foetus in the womb required three elements: the creative spirit, semen, and blood. The god provided the first, man the second, and woman the third. Of the human contributions, woman's was the most powerful and evoked most wonder among the ancients. They believed that it was menstrual blood that formed the embryo. Pliny describes the process thus: "(menses is) the material for human generation, as semen from the male acting like rennet collects this substance within it, which thereupon is inspired with life and endowed with body".' Women who do not menstruate, records the same author, do not bear children, since the raw material of conception is not present in the womb. On the other hand, a woman who menstruates during pregnancy is likely to bring forth "a sickly or still-born offspring, or one full of bloody matter". The best time for conceiving was thought to be at the beginning or end of a menstrual period,2 which is why in the story of David and Bathsheba in the Old Testament it is said specifically that the lovers had their illicit intercourse just after Bathsheba had menstruated (II Sam 11:4).</p>
   <p>Galen, the second—century physician, has a rather more sophisticated theory of the generative process, but still sees semen and menstrual blood as its main factors. The semen, he thought, drew to itself just as much blood as it could deal with, using it as food with which to build the foetus. 3 The Old Testament rules for the menstruant (Lev 15:19—25) emphasize the sacred nature of the blood. Whilst in that condition, everything the woman touches is reckoned "unclean" and this "uncleanness" can communicate itself to other people. A man having intercourse with her at this time renders himself liable to the same seven—day period of ritual disqualification as his wife. It has to be emphasized that this "uncleanness" has nothing to do with morals or hygiene. It is a religious state of taboo. A woman bearing a son is similarly "defiled" (having a daughter requires fourteen days separation), as is a man coming in contact with a dead body (Num 19:11). A priest is rendered "unclean" by touching a reptile or insect, or involuntarily discharging semen (Lev 22 4,). Rachel used her real or pretended menstrual condition to prevent her sorely pressed father Laban from discovering his stolen property. When he finally caught up with his runaway daughter and son-in-law, Laban searched their tents seeking some household gods Rachel had taken. She put them under her camel saddle and begged to be excused from rising since the "manner of women was upon her" (Gen 31 :341). Even to have touched the saddle would have rendered Laban "unclean".</p>
   <p>Menses could affect almost everything, by remote influence as well as direct contact. "Wild indeed", says Pliny, "are the stories told of the mysterious and awful power of the menstruous discharge..." He relates a few of them and leaves us in no doubt about the fear and wonder that attended this monthly phenomenon in the eyes of the ancients. Of course, coming from the seat of creation, the womb, menstrual blood was credited with wonderful healing powers. It could cure gout, scrofitla, parotid tumours, abscesses, erysipelas, boils, eye— fluxes, hydrophobia, and epilepsy, whilst quartan fever, according to one source, could be counteracted by sexual intercourse with a woman just beginning her period.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, such a source of power was dangerous. Under the principle of like repelling like, which played an important part in ancient philosophy, menses was also considered to be an abortifacient. A smear of the blood could bring about a miscarriage, and even to step over a stain could bring about the same dire effect.5 Similarly, it could abort fruit trees, dry up seed, blight crops, turn wine sour, as well as send dogs mad, rust metals, and dull mirrors. This last effect, incidentally, could be reversed by having the woman stare at the back of the mirror until the shine on the front was restored.</p>
   <p>The distinguishing feature of menstrual blood was its dark colour, contrasting with the brighter, oxygenated blood of the rest of the body. Thus dark red, purple, violet, and similar hues came to have a special significance, being so closely associated with fertility. Kings and magistrates wore purple garments, and the Latin purpura came to mean not only the robes themselves but the high dignity they conferred.7 Most prized of all was Tyrian purple, whose "highest glory", according to Pliny, "consists in the colour of congealed blood, blackish at first glance but gleaming when held up to the light; this is the origin of Homer's phrase, 'blood of purple hue' "8 Further dyeing of a scarlet fabric with Tyrian purple produced the rich colour called in Greek husginon, the Sumerian origin of which shows that it meant properly "blue blood",9 another popular mark of the aristocracy. The same origin can be found for the "Hyacinth", in Greek mythology the name of the youth accidentally slain by his friend Apollo, and from whose spilt blood there grew the flower of that name. 10 Pliny offers a further connection between purple and menstrual blood when he says that the latter adversely affects this colour, another example of like repelling like. 11</p>
   <p>There is another reference to menstrual blood in the description Pliny gives of a fabulous dragon called the basiisk. It could apparently, kill bushes with its breath, scorch grass, burst rocks,'2 and put other serpents to rout. 13 It was its blood, however, that was most in demand. According to the Magi, it brought a successful outcome to petitions made to gods and kings, cured diseases, and disarmed sorcery. This last claim was also made for menses, if daubed like Passover blood (Exod 12:7), on the subject's doorposts.'4</p>
   <p>The name basiisk actually means, "womb—blood",'5 that is, menses. Pliny adds that some people call it "Saturn's blood", which looks like a reminiscence of the same verbal origin, since the name Saturn is partly composed of a Sumerian word ShA-TUR, "womb".'° One important characteristic of "Saturn's Blood" was that it was of the colour and consistency of pitch.'7 The ancients saw a close relationship between this substance and menstrual blood, apparently believing that it was the earth's equivalent of human menses. Particularly noted in this connection were the lumps of bitumen that periodically rose to the surface of the Dead Sea, "in shape and size", according to Josephus, "like decapitated bulls". He goes on, "the labourers on the lake row up to these and, catching hold of the lumps, haul them into their boats. But when they have filled them it is no easy task to detach their cargo, which, owing to its tenacious and glutinous character, clings to the boat until it is loosened by the menstrual discharge of women."18 This tradition is mentioned also by Tacitus,19 referring to other ancient authorities among whom, we know, was one Poseidonius of second- first-century BC. So the relationship between pitch and menses was already well—established and can now be further supported linguistically. 20</p>
   <p>The connection of pitch with the womb would lead us to expect that it should be thought to have healing properties. As Josephus says, "it is useful not only for caulking ships, but also for the healing of the body, forming an ingredient in many medicines".21 Dioscorides lists at some length the remedial characteristics of asp ha itos, including that it is effective for "strangulations of the womb", and that, taken along with wine and castor oil, "it drives out menses".22 The Judean bitumen is the best, according to the same authority, and he notes that "it shines like purple"</p>
   <p>The inhabitants of Judea must have been well aware that the extraordinary rift valley of the Dead Sea was far lower than the surrounding country. In fact, as we know, the ground there is the lowest place on earth, some thirteen hundred feet below sea—level. It was small wonder, then, that the menstrual discharge of the womb of mother earth should be borne the comparatively short distance to the surface of the Dead Sea, and that it should have required the application of the menses of other wombs to loosen its sticky grip.</p>
   <p>Perhaps the Dead Sea's proximity to the centre of the earth, and thus the seat of knowledge, played some part in the establishment along its western shores of the Essene settlement at Qumran, the home of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Certainly the blistering heat of the summer months, combined with the belief that there one stood closer than anywhere else to the eternal fires of Hades, had a large part in the formulation of the Sodom and Gomorrah myths, and their overthrow with fire and brimstone (Gen 19:24).</p>
   <p>Further evidence of how close the ground here is to the fermenting heat of the earth's centre was recognized in the presence of hot springs on the east side of the Dead Sea, at a place called Callirrhoe. It was thence that the dying Herod was carried to try to find some relief from the pains that wracked his dropsical, gangrenous body.23 As late as the last century, popular local belief held that the hot water was released from the lower regions by evil spirits, merely to stop it being available to assuage the pains of the damned in hell. Another legend said that King Solomon sent a servant to open the springs when he discovered how thin was the crust of the earth at this point. However, lest the threats of the subterranean devils deter his messenger, the wise monarch saw to it that he was stone deaf.24 Near by stood Herod's great palace fortress Machaerus, and in its grounds, says Josephus, "gr ew a plant of Rue, of an amazing size; inde ed in height and thickness no fig-tree surpassed it".25 ^| was regarded as the prime abortifacient. as its various names now make clear.26 Pliny said that it would open the womb, promote menstruation, bringing away the after-birth and dead foetus, good for "womb— strangling", for the genitals and anus, and at all costs to be avoided by pregnant women.27</p>
   <p>Josephus' digression to speak of a particular Rue plant in a topographical account of the Machaerus fortress as it bore on a vital Roman campaign in Transjordan, is strange, to say the least. But we have already seen, when describing the high priest's head—gear, that the introduction by this author of plant physiology and folk-lore into an otherwise non-botanical discussion usually implies some hidden reference to a matter which he is reluctant to bring fully into the open.</p>
   <p>Immediately following the description of the giant-sized Rue and its comparison with a fig, Josephus says that in a ravine to the north of the fortress town, was to be found a magic plant called by the name of the ravine, Baaras. What he says about the plant tallies in some respects with traditional accounts of the Mandrake, which we have identified with the Holy Plant, the sacred fungus. One method of drawing it from the ground safely was to tie a dog to it, then call the animal to follow. The animal sprang to obey, pulling out the Mandrake, and promptly died, "a vicarious victim, as it were, for him who intended to remove the plant, since after this none need fear to handle it". The canine sacrifice was well worth the prize, since "it possesses one virtue for which it is valued; for the so-called demons — in other words, the spirits of wicked men which enter the living and kill them unless aid is forthcoming — are promptly expelled by this root, if merely applied to the patients".28</p>
   <p>Of more immediate interest is the alternative method offered for capturing the root. "It eludes the grasp of persons who approach with the intention of plucking it, as it shrinks up and can only be made to stand still by pouring upon it a woman's urine and menses".29 Thus the releasing agents for the Mandrake were the same as for the Dead Sea's bitumen. Furthermore, the Rue which shared some of the medicinal and I abortive characteristics of pitch, was highly regarded in antiquity as an antidote to poisons, particularly of seipents and fimgi.30 We may therefore suspect that in Josephus' mention of the hot spring of Machaerus, the giant Rue and the Mandrake in the same passage, he is quietly.expressing a currently held belief that this particular location by the Dead Sea held a special relevance for the Holy Plant and its antidote. One or two other references support this idea, as we shall see.</p>
   <p>The ancients recognized a homogeneity between mineral pitch and the resin of trees, particularly the pine, to which the name "pitch" more properly belongs. Thus Greek has the term pissasphaltos, that is, as Pliny remarks, "pitch combined with bitumen",31 and this author states that bitumen is commonly adulterated with vegetable pitch.32 Acacia was another tree whose resinous sap was compared with human menses. Pliny says that its "purple gum" had the best tonic and cooling properties and "checked excessive menstruation".3 The Arabs are said to make amulets from the gum of the Acacia with the idea that it is the tree's menstrual blood, and that they may thereby avail themselves of its power.34 The Acacia shared honours with the Cedar for providing wood for the furniture of the Jewish sanctuary, and was even used to construct the ark itself (Deut 10:3; Exod a:5; etc).</p>
   <p>Another property shared by both bitumen and resin is their inflammability. Both are sources of fire, a necessary ingredient of generation. As we said earlier, the Sumerian ideogram for "love" consisted of a burning torch in a womb.3 The dull-red tip of the penis was thought of as a fiery brand igniting the furnace of the uterus, as the sun each evening set alight the bituminous heart of the earth. As Job says, "As for the earth, out of it comes bread; but underneath it is turned up as by fire" (Job 28 :). So a pine-torch was carried in wedding processions, as the virgins of the New Testament parable of the Kingdom bore their lamps to meet the bridegroom (Matt 25). In the same way, torch-carrying formed part of the fertility rites of Bacchus.36</p>
   <p>The same symbolism lies behind the seven-branched candlestick before the Holy of Holies in the Jewish temple (Exod 25:3 if.). The phallic nature of the lamps is illustrated by the terminology of its biblical description, beginning with the base as the "loins" out of which the "stalk" rises with its seven arms. On the top of each was "a cup shaped like an almond", consisting of a "rounded knob", or "capital", and a "flower", or "bud". It is as difficult to envisage this ornamentation in literal terms as it is Josephus' description of the High Priest's phallic head—gear. However, the reference to the "almond" is a clue to the intended symbolism of the whole, since the name of the tree derives from a Sumerian original meaning "stretched penis",37 an allusion to the tree's being the first to show its blossom.38 The erection of the male organ was its "awakening" and in Sumerian the idea was used to express sunrise. 39</p>
   <p>The lamps before the Holy of Holies in the Temple find expression today in the lighted candles before the Virgin Mary in the Catholic Church. The fertility significance of the practice is particularly clear in the fire ritual of Holy Saturday, as the Church prepares for the rising of the Christ on Easter Day. "New fire" is struck from a flint as a prelude to the ceremonies, and coals lit from it outside the church. The fire is blessed and brought into the church, eventually to light one candle in which five grains of incense have been placed. Towards the climax of the ritual, the biblical Creation story having been read, the part played by the creative waters are rehearsed before the baptismal font. Prayer is offered that God, "by a secret mixture of his divine power, may render fruitful this water for the regeneration of men: to the end that those who are sanctified in the immaculate womb of this divine font, and born again new creatures, may come forth as heavenly offspring</p>
   <p>Therefore, may all unclean spirits by thy command, 0 Lord, depart from hence: may all the malice of diabolical wiles be entirely banished</p>
   <p>Later the priest breathes three times upon the water in the form of a cross, saying: "Do thou with thy mouth bless these pure waters. *." and dips the candle three times into the water "of the immaculate womb", saying: "May the power of the Holy Ghost descend into all the water of this font..." After breathing again three times on the water, he goes on, "and make the whole substance of this water fruitful for regeneration".</p>
   <p>The classical example of the ever-burning fire before a virgin goddess is the cult of Hestia-Vesta, the Greek and Roman representations of the hearth-deity. The names and cults of the goddesses differ in some respects but their origin is the same. The Greek Hestia's name is also the common word for "fireplace" and "home", as well as for the central fire of the universe. Euripides calls her "the Lady of Fire".40</p>
   <p>Her domain was originally in the king's palace, but in the historical period it had become transferred to the town hail, the council-chamber of the magistrates, called in Greek prutaneion.41</p>
   <p>Her mythology tells us that she spurned the hands of both Poseidon and Apollo: "she was unwilling, nay stubbornly refused; and touching the head of her father Zeus... that fair goddess swore a great oath that has in truth been fulfilled, that she would be a virgin all her days". As recompense for this great sacrifice, "Zeus the Father gave her high honour instead of marriage, and she has her place in the midst of the house, and has the richest portion. In all the temples of the gods she has a share of the honour, and among all mortal men she is chief of the goddesses".42</p>
   <p>Not only was Hestia honoured in the council-chambers, but at every banquet wine was poured for her at the beginning and end of the meal.43 For she was the first and the last of the children of Zeus, the beginning and end of the god's creation. Legend had it that the god swallowed each of his children at the moment of birth, but was ultimately forced to disgorge them. Hestia, being the first—born was the last to be regurgitated, and so merited this title.44</p>
   <p>This fancy is simply an attempt to put into mythical terms a central feature of the old fertility philosophy. It was believed that the first-born of the womb was the strongest of all the progeny because it was formed from menstrual blood at its most powerful. Next in excellence to the firstborn of the young woman, stood the child of an older woman conceiving for the first time, just prior to menopause. The idea seems to have been that for some reason irregular menstrual discharge was more powerful than that which occurred at normal monthly intervals. So an adolescent girl's first period, like that of the older woman who had retained her virginity, was "spontaneous", and thus all-powerful. It is strong enough, says Pliny, "to make mares miscarry even at the sight of it over long distances".45</p>
   <p>Menstruation was, naturally enough, connected with the moon, the "queen of stars" whose periodic waxing and waning controlled the blood of humans and sap of plants. As Pliny puts it: "the moon is rightly believed to be the star of the spirit... that saturates the earth and fills bodies by its approach and empties them by its departure.. the blood even of humans increases and diminishes with its light, and leaves and herbage... are sensitive to it, the same force penetrating into all things".46 Should menstrual discharge occur when the moon was not visible the blood was reckoned to have uncontrollable power:</p>
   <p>"if this female force should issue when the moon or the sun is in eclipse, it will cause irremediable harm; no less so when there is no moon. At such seasons sexual intercourse brings death and disease upon the man."47</p>
   <p>In biblical mythology this idea of the potency of the first and last menses is expressed in stories of heroes born to aged, previously barren or virgin mothers, like Isaac (Gen 17), Samuel (I Sam i), and Jesus. The New Testament describes the god—hero, like Hestia, as "the first and the last, the beginning and the end" (Rev 22:13), and "the first-born of all creation" (Col i : i). Jesus is also "the first—born of many brethren" (Rom 8:28), since participation in the mystery of ingesting the Jesus— fungus, was to avail oneself of the power of his primogeniture.</p>
   <p>It will be appreciated that this sacred virginity, attributed somewhat incongruously to goddesses who spend most of their mythical lives leaping in and out of bed with gods and mortals, is not primarily or even essentially to do with having intact hymens. Their "virginity" lay in the power of their wombs to produce offspring whose excellence derived from menstrual blood perpetually at its most powerful.</p>
   <p>The Roman version of the hearth-cult demonstrates certain features which are probably more primitive than the Greek. The central feature of the Vesta worship was the maintenance of an ever-burning sacred fire48 by virgins, called Vestals. Originally representing the royal house, these maids, at first two, then four and later six in number,49 were called "princesses" and given special privileges in accordance with their assumed rank. They dressed as brides, indicative of their virginity, and were between the ages of six and ten,50 serving for five years,51 that is, until the onset of puberty and marriageable age. In historical times this period of service was extended to thirty years, perhaps with the idea of bringing them into the second most powerful period of their reproductive lives. Marriage was permitted after their time of service but was unusual, being considered unlucky.52</p>
   <p>The girls were released from parental control when they were admitted to the sacred office of Vestal, but thereafter came under the charge of the high—priest, the ponqfex maximus. It was he who received them into the Order, taking each candidate by the hand and pronouncing a formula of admission over her. Her hair was then cut off and hung upon a certain tree.</p>
   <p>Discipline was severe. If a Vestal neglected to maintain the sacred fire before the virgin goddess she was beaten. If she lost her virginity she was walled up in an underground tomb to die — or be rescued by the direct intervention of the goddess whom she had betrayed. Her duties involved bringing water from a sacred spring to use in the sanctuary, and the preparation of special foodstuffs. She also had the care of certain objects in the shrine. Since no one but the Vestals was allowed to enter the inner sanctum, little is known of the rituals and the holy objects of the shrine. As with most information about the mystery cults, accounts that have come down stem largely from guesswork.</p>
   <p>At the time of the Roman New Year, our Eastertide, a ceremony of extinguishing and relighting the sacred fire was enacted. The Church strikes "new fire" from a flint; the Vestals used a fire— drill boring into a block of wood, an invention attributed to Hermes,53 with whom the hearth— goddess was associated.</p>
   <p>The shrine itself was a domed building, representing a potter's or refiner's furnace. Fire, in fertility philosophy, not only engendered new life, it purified the old. It is the Semitic word for a refiner's crucible that underlies the New Testament conception of "temptation", properly, i "testing, trial". So, for the theologians, the eternal fires of hell became the place of purging of the souls of the dead, and later Judaism and Christianity embodied this aspect of the fertility cult into their moral teaching.</p>
   <p>The shape of the Vesta shrine had another significance for the mushroom cult, since it also represented the domed canopy of the expanded cap of the Amanita muscaria. Inside the shrine was preserved a thunderbolt cast down by Zeus, it was said, at the founding of the city of Troy.55 To judge from the tradition that this votive object was a replica of the patron goddess Pallas Athena, whose name and epithet both mean vulva",56 and bearing in mind the traditional shape of the divine thunderbolt, a kind of dumb-bell or divided hemispheres, (z),57 it seems reasonable to assume that the Palladium, as this venerated relic was called, was in fact a representation of the sacred mushroom.</p>
   <p>Fire and fertility are similarly connected in the person of the Greek goddess of child-birth, Eileithyia. She is depicted standing with one arm raised holding a pine-torch, the other outstretched with open palm, a gesture of prayer for an easy delivery.58 She was the daughter of Zeus and Hera, "semen" and "womb", and the name seems to be an amalgam of two elements which otherwise appear in Greek names for the Pine, Elate and Thuia. Both in origin mean "fluid of generation", that is, "menses".60 Confirmation of this comes from the botanist Theophrastus who says of the resinous extraction of Silver-fir (Elate) that "it is what the prophets call 'the menses of Eileithyia', and for which they make atonement".6' Thus, in Eileithyia we have a personification of menstrual blood, cedar resin, and creative fire.</p>
   <p>The common Sumerian word for "Cedar" is ERIN, and this appears in another Greek word for "torch", helene, or helane. Here also is the source and meaning of the name of the Greek heroine and goddess, Helen.62 As we saw earlier, she is portrayed in classical mythology as the daughter of Nemesis (or Leda) and Zeus, the result of her father's mating with her mother in the form of a swan. She was thus born from an egg, like her brothers Pollux and Castor. Nemesis, whose name has come down as the personification of divine retribution, is identical in meaning with the Sumerian original of Nectar, the "fate—decider", which otherwise appears as Mandrake, the sacred mushroom, or as the Seinites called it, "the egg plant".63</p>
   <p>A further link between Helen and Nectar appears in the drink Nectarion, wine spiced with a wonderful drug called Helenion, named after the good queen Helen. Legend has it that on one occasion when a supper party in the palace of Menelaus looked like being wrecked on the rocks of immoderate grief that followed the recounting of a particularly harrowing tale, Helen laced the company's wine with "a drug to quiet all pain and strife, and bring forgetfulness of every ill". Homer describes this pain-killer further: "Who so should drink this down, when it is mingled in the bowl, would not in the course of that day let a tear fall down over his cheeks, no, not though his mother and father should lie there dead, or though men before his face should slay with the sword his brother or dear son, and his own eyes beheld it."</p>
   <p>Pliny says that Helenion had its origins in the queen's "tears", adding, for good measure, that it was particularly popular in the island of Helene. 65 One supposes it was especially favoured among the ladies, for it was reputed "to preserve physical charm, and to keep unimpaired the fresh complexion of our women, whether of the face or of the rest of the body. Moreover, it is supposed that, by its use, they gain a kind of attractiveness and sex—appeal (veneremque conciliari)". It also killed mice.66</p>
   <p>The "tears of Helen" will be the drops of resin that exude from the pine tree. Besides giving the fire of the processional torch (Greek helene), and the intoxicant and beautifier Helenion, prime ingredient of Nectarion, this resin was thought to be the source of the sacred mushroom, the Amanita muscaria. As Pliny says, "the fungi... are all derived from the gum that exudes from trees."67 It is to the gum of the pine that an Accadian incantation is directed: "0 kukru, kukru, kukru, in the pure, holy mountains thou hast engendered 'little-ones' by a sacred prostitute, 'seeds—of—a—Pine' by a vestal. »",8 with the plea that whatever sorcery may thus have been begotten shall be dispersed. The "little- ones" and its parallel phrase "seeds—of—a—Pine" are clearly substitute- words for some magic vegetation too powerful even to be given their proper names. Their manner of "engendering" by sacred prostitutes and their resinous origin leave little doubt that it is the Amanita muscaria that is here involved, the "fate-deciding" Nectar. The name by which the incantation addresses the pine-resin, kukru, is another link with the "swan" motif of the myth of Helen's birth. Both names go back to a Sumerian phrase meaning "pod": in the case of the Pine referring to that species which have kernels like small lice "pods", earning the name of'louse_tree"6$8; and as regards the "swan", because like other fertility-birds, its name was connected with the "womb- pod".69</p>
   <p>Helen's name, as we saw, means also "pine-torch" and an important source of names and attendant mythologies connected with the Amanita muscaria stem from its red canopy, studded with white flecks.7° Furthermore, the cap has an extremely bitter, "fiery" taste, and a combination of both characteristics is partly responsible for the "burning coal" imagery of Isaiah: "Then flew one of the seraphim to me, having in his hand a burning coal which he had taken with tongs from the altar. And he touched my mouth..." (Isa 6:6, 7). Josephus describes the Baaras plant of Machaerus as "flame-coloured and towards evening emitting a brilliant light".71 It is the same kind of conception that underlies the vision of the "son of man" standing in the midst of the seven golden lampstands, 'his face "like the sun shining in full strength" (Rev I:12ff.), and of Moses whose face "shone because he had been talking with God" (Exod 34:29). In later chapters we shall be looking in more detail at the allusions in names and colour to the striking deep red or purple cap of the Amanita muscaria. Even the white flecking caused by the fragments of the volva adhering to the surface was the subject of special epithets, not only on account of the peculiar colouring effect but because the "scabby" aspect reminded the myth—makers of skin diseases, particularly leprosy.</p>
   <p>In this chapter we have seen how human gestation of the foetus in the womb was paralleled in the eyes of the ancients by the growth of the sacred fungus from the menses—like resins of certain trees, particularly the conifers. These were particularly powerful, personified in mythology by the goddess of childbirth, Eileithyia, and by Helen, sister of the mushroom pair, Castor and Pollux. The equivalent of such menstrual blood in human women could only be found in that of virgins, and females having their first child. Here, also, was another reason for seeing the product of the "virgin" vulva of the mushroom a very special growth endued with abnormal power. If the sacred fungus was related by name and gestation to the female organs, the cult which centred on the Amanita muscaria depended in large measure on female participation. We have now to look at the role of the cultic prostitute in this and related religious practices.</p>

   <h2>IX. The Sacred Prostitute</h2>
   <p>In the incantation to the pine—resin quoted in the last chapter, the "little ones" were said to have been engendered by "a sacred prostitute". This cultic office was well known in the ancient world. It is usually assumed that the woman dedicated herself to the service of the god as a sexual partner in some imitative ritual designed to stimulate the generative faculties of the fertility deity. Doubtless in many of the cults she did perform such a function, copulating before the altar with the priests or other male worshippers at certain festivals. However, that this was not her only form of service, or even necessarily her prime function, is indicated by the vegetation reference of the kukru incantation.</p>
   <p>In the Bible, the cultic title is used in one case when the woman plays the part of a common whore, where Tamar seduced her father-in-law at the road—side (Gen 38), but elsewhere the sacred prostitute plays her proper religious role, and is associated like her sister of the kukru incantation with hills and trees. Thus Hosea describes the apostate Israelites as harlots "sacrificing on the tops of mountains, making offerings upon the hills, under oak, poplar, and terebinth, because their shade is good" (Hos4:13 [Heb. 14}).l</p>
   <p>The Old Testament speaks also of male cult prostitutes, called otherwise "dogs". It is more likely that these persons were sodomites than that they served the female worshippers as counterparts to the feminine cult prostitutes. In which case the epithet "dog" is not necessarily a term of abuse, but merely descriptive of their manner of copulation.2 It is perhaps significant that one of the Sumerian terms for "chanter- priest" is GALA, elsewhere meaning "womb", with a semantic equivalent, USh—KU, literally, "penis-anus". Their prime purpose may then have been as a means of providing or extracting semen for cultic purposes, particularly for the priest's anointing as a symbolic "phallus" before the god, a "christ".</p>
   <p>However that may be, it is the vegetative function of the female cult-prostitute that must engage our main attention. In the kukru incantation, she is credited with engendering the "little ones" from the tree's "menses", the resin. Bearing in mind the phallic form of the sacred mushroom, it is reasonable to assume that her task was to "seduce" the little "penis" from the ground by sexual wiles. Josephus tells us that to stop the Mandrake "shrinking away from the touch" and to make it "stand still" one was required to pour upon it the menses and urine of a woman.4 Where the cult prostitute was herself present this was probably achieved directly, involving exposing her genitals to that part of the ground where the mushroom was thought to lie dormant.</p>
   <p>Self-exposure of a menstruating woman for vegetative purposes is elsewhere recorded. Pliny says that, in order to utilize the harmful effect menses was believed to have upon "caterpillars, worms, beetles and other vermin", menstruants "walked around the cornfield naked", and the vermin fell to the ground. It was said that the discovery of the effects of menses in this respect was made initially in Cappadocia, "owing to a plague there of Spanish fly, so that women... walk through the middle of the fields with their clothes pulled up above the buttocks".5</p>
   <p>There are indications that it was considered necessary to make some sort of booth or covering for the witch and the magic plant during the seduction. Hosea in the passage just quoted specifies that the sacred prostitutes practised their art under trees where "the shade is good". Ezekiel, in a most interesting passage describing the activities of female necromancers, speaks of some kind of full-length veil by which they "ensnared souls" (Ezek 13:18). The Holy Plant had to be uprooted under cover of darkness, "lest the act be seen by the woodpecker of Mars" (perhaps a folk—name for the red—topped Amanita muscaria),6 or the sun and moon.7</p>
   <p>Among the Accadian magical texts is an instruction for the uprooting of the tigilla, the bolt- or phallus-plant, or mushroom. We have already met the Sumerian original of this name, UKUSh-TI-GIL-LA, a jumbled version of which gave the Greek name Glukuside, Glycyside, for the Holy Plant. 8</p>
   <p>Go, my son [it reads], the tigilla, which springs up of its own accord in the desert — when the sun enters its dwelling, cover your head with a cloth, and cover the tigilla, surrounding it with flour, and in the morning before sunrise root it out of its place, and take its root...9</p>
   <p>The necessity for covering oneself and the magic plant during the process of taking it from the ground, reminds one of another of those apparently banal asides of Josephus when describing the mysterious Essenes. In the midst of an important passage about their manner of discipline, he turns aside to tell us exactly how they perform their natural functions:</p>
   <p>They dig a trench a foot deep with a mattock — such is the nature of the small axe which they present to the neophytes — and wrapping their mantle about them, that they may not offend the rays of the deity, they squat above it. They then replace the excavated soil in the trench. For this purpose they select the more desolate places. And although this discharge of the excrements is a natural function, they make it a rule to wash themselves after it, as if defiled.'0</p>
   <p>Everything here except the ritual purification is decreed in Jewish Law (Deut 23:12W.), and is no more than commonsense camp hygiene. There seems no point at all in the astute author wasting space describing this normal practice unless he means to convey another of his tidbits of secret information for those who want to look beneath the surface. The reference to the "rays of the deity" and the lustration might give substance to the idea.</p>
   <p>The shading by veil or booth of the mushroom-seeker was accompanied by other means of magical protection. Reference is made to drawing circles round the plant and its plunderer with a sword, the metal itself being considered fraught with supernatural power.' 1 Another form of protection was to sprinkle flour round the plant, as the seeker of the tigilla was instructed in the Accadian incantation. In this case the encirclement offered some measure of protection and the flour was a token of compensation to the earth for its rape, as Pliny says when Asclepios, another name for the sacred fungus, is taken: "it is a pious duty to fill in the hole with various cereals as an atonement to the earth". 12 It is the same principle at work when the seers offered atonement to the Pine on taking the precious resin called Eileithyia, the "menses".3 The fundamental principle of fertility philosophy was that of balance, as we have previously notecL14 To take any of the fruits of the earth necessitated some measure of compensation or sacrifice to the god. To be effective this return payment should be at least qualitatively equivalent to the gift received, so that only the best of the harvest, the first— reaped of the corn and first-born of the animals, was suitable. In the case of an especially powerful plant like the sacred mushroom, an atoning substitution posed special problems. Since the fungus was the god himself made manifest on earth, no atoning sacrifice by mortals could suffice. The seeker could only bring along with him the Holy Plant itself or some symbol of it, and this is probably the explanation of a curious phrase in Josephus' description of the seizing of the Mandrake:</p>
   <p>"to touch it is fatal unless one succeeds in bringing along the thing itself, the root, hanging from one's hand".'5 The verb he uses, epiphero, elsewhere refers to the bringing of a dowry by a bride to her husband, or the supplying of his own rations by the soldier himself during a campaign. In other words, only the god can atone for himself, and herein lies the basis of the Christian doctrine of the Incarnation and Atonement, which we must examine afresh in its cultic context in a later chapter.</p>
   <p>Ezekiel in describing the necromantic ritual of the witches, says they fastened "magic bands" (kesdtot) on their wrists, and with them "trapped souls like birds" (Ezek 13:20). This rare word is related to the Sumerian Kl-ShU, meaning some kind of magical imprisonment, but we have to look to Greek for its precise significance. In the form kiste, Latin cista, it appears as a container used in certain mystery rituals of the Dionysiac cult, supposedly for the carrying of secret implements. In fact, wherever the cista is graphically represented it is shown as a basket from which a snake is emerging. Thus on sarcophagi inscribed with Bacchic scenes, the cista is shown being kicked open by Pan and the snake raising itself from the half-opened lid. 16 The snake is an important feature of the Dionysiac cult and imagery. The Maenacls of Euripides' Bacchae have serpents entwined in their hair and round their limbs, and the snake was the particular emblem of the Phrygian Sabazios (Sabadius) with whom Dionysus is identified. 17</p>
   <p>It is not difficult to see the reasoning behind the ancient connection between the serpent and the mushroom, which played such a large part in mushroom folk-lore and mythology. Both emerged from holes in the ground in a manner reminiscent of the erection of the sexually awakened penis, and both bore in their heads a fiery poison which the ancients believed could be transferred from one to the other. "If the hole of a serpent", writes Pliny, "has been near the mushroom, or should a serpent have breathed on it as it first opened, its kinship to poisons makes it capable of absorbing the venom. So it would not be well to eat mushrooms until the serpent has begun to hibernate." 18</p>
   <p>The prime example of the relation between the serpent and the mushroom is, of course, in the Garden of Eden story of the Old Testament. The cunning reptile prevails upon Eve and her husband to eat of the tree, whose fruit "made them as gods, knowing good and evil" (Gen 3:4). The whole Eden story is mushroom-based mythology, not least in the identity of the "tree" as the sacred fungus, as we shall see. 19 Even as late as the thirteenth-century some recollection of the old tradition was known among Christians, to judge from a fresco painted on the wall of a ruined church in Plaincourault in France (pi. 2). There the Amanita muscaria is gloriously portrayed, entwined with a serpent, whilst Eve stands by holding her belly.20</p>
   <p>The Bacchic cista and Ezekiel's witches' "magic bands" were, then, probably meant to represent the lower "cup" of the mushroom volva, the little "basket" from which the stalk of the fungus emerged, like a snake being charmed from its box. In this conception lies the origin of such stories as Moses, the "emergent serpent", as now we may understand his name to mean,21 in his papyrus ark, and Dionysus and Jesus in their "mangers", in essence, "covered baskets".22 As objects attached to the wrists of the sacred prostitutes at the mushroom—raising ceremony, these replicas of the matted volva, perhaps already divided to reveal the emergent mushroom stem, were probably intended to offer a kind of imitative encouragement to the dormant fungus to open and reveal itself.</p>
   <p>The ability of a woman even by her physical presence to induce a man's sex organ to stir into life apparently without any control on its owner's part, must have been a source of great wonder to the ancients. It was sorcery, and as such viewed with apprehension and distrust by men generally, not unmixed with religious awe. This was particularly the case with those mystic orders which made use of the sexual power of women for their secret rites. Of the Essenes Josephus says: "They do not, indeed, on principle, condemn wedlock and the propagation of the human race, but they wish to protect themselves against woman's wantonness, being persuaded that none of the sex keeps her plighted troth to one man."23 Of that order of Essenes who did marry, he says:</p>
   <p>"They think that those who decline to marry cut off the chief function of life, the propagation of the race, and, what is more, that, were all to adopt the same view, the whole race would very quickly die out. They give their wives, however, three years' probation, and only marry them after they have, by three periods of purification, given proof of fecundity. 24 They have no intercourse with them during pregnancy, thus showing that their motive in marrying is not self-indulgence but the procreation of children."25</p>
   <p>One is reminded of the Church's oft—reiterated edict that the purpose of marriage is the procreation of children. It comes as something of a shock to us in the Western world, after centuries of religiously inspired puritanism, to learn that the ancients attributed the greater inclinations towards sexual indulgence to women. It was said that the seer Teiresias was chosen by Zeus and Hera to decide on the question whether the male or the female derived most pleasure from sexual intercourse. He replied that "of the ten parts of coitus, a man enjoys one only; but a woman's senses enjoy all ten to the flill".26</p>
   <p>However that may be, there is no doubt that the sexual power of women was vital to the mystery cults, and accounts in large measure for their attractiveness to women from the earliest times. It also has much to do with the antagonism towards sexuality generally and the distrust of women displayed by the later Church, and the readiness with which supposed witches were hounded by Christians until quite recent times. The telepathic control over people's minds exercised by such females; known the world over as "the evil eye", came originally from.this ability to arouse men's passions. The Latin fascinus, from which our "fascination" comes, as well as meaning "bewitching", was also the proper name of a deity whose emblem was the erect penis, and this indeed, as we can now appreciate, is the original source of this word and the Greek baskanos, "sorcerer".2? It was believed that the malign influences of "fascination", which came to be extended to any form of mental dominance, could be averted by wearing on the person a model penis, rather as the Christian symbol of the Cross is currently displayed by those within and without the Church to ward off evil. The worship of Fascinus was entrusted to the Vestal Virgins,28 a further indication of the sexual nature of their sacred fire. A similar connection between sexual influence and sorcery appears in the derivation of our word "magic". Its immediate source is the Latin magus, representing the Old Persian magush, the title of a religious official whose power of mind and body earned him a reputation for sorcery. We have met the Magi earlier as one of the prime sources in the ancient writings for plant names and medicinal folk-lore. Their title may now be traced to a Sumerian phrase for "big-penis", and seen to be cognate with the Greek pharmakos, "enchanter, wizard", from which comes our "pharmacist".29</p>
   <p>Women, then, had an important part to play in the mushroom cult. Nil It made them at once respected and feared. Their power over men and particularly over the male organ seemed magical, and the technical term for this influence, "fascination", became extended to any form of mental dominance, usually of a malign character.</p>
   <p>Details of the way in which the cultic prostitutes drew forth the lat phallic mushroom can only be deduced from names and scattered references in literature. But one term seems continually in evidence in describing their activities, "lamentation". Just what this implies in its religious sense is the subject of our next chapter.</p>
   
   <h2>X. Religious Lamentation</h2>
   <p>Religious lamentation is a curious phenomenon. This sympathetic identification of the worshipper with a suffering god seems to be a necessary part of most religions, particularly those in which women play an active role. To see Catholic women, particularly in the Mediterranean countries, wracked with real grief at Eastertide as they contemplate the Crucifix and the wounds of their Lord, can leave little doubt that they are suffering real mental anguish. Doubtless the female votaries of the goddess Ishtar, bemoaning the fate of her husband Tammuz, in whatever terms the myth was recounted throughout the ancient Near East, were as genuinely moved in their emotions as the tearful suppliant at the foot of the Cross.</p>
   <p>There is apparently in human beings, and in women particularly, a capacity for sympathetic grief which demands dramatic expression, however artificially contrived the stimulant, however historically improbable the tragic events and persons they re—enact in their imaginations. Aristotle, some twenty—two centuries ago, defined tragedy as "the imitation of an action that is serious, and also, as having magnitude, complete in itself... with incidents arousing pity and terror, with which to accomplish its purgations of these emotions". 1</p>
   <p>The psychologist will doubtless trace this female capacity for altruistic suffering to her sexual constitution. The curse pronounced upon womankind in Eden that she must find her physical fulfillment in pain has the ring of profound psychological truth: "I will greatly multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, yet your sexual desire shall be to your man even while he rules over you" (Gen3:16).</p>
   <p>Certainly, ritual lamentation has a sexual significance as can now be demonstrated by its terminology. Whatever inward emotional satisfaction the practice of lamenting the dead god may have achieved, its objective intention was to bring him back to life. In the case of agricultural communities, the dead god is but a personification of the fertility of the soil, deemed to have perished during the hot summer months but capable of being revivified under the influence of the autumn and spring rains, the spermatozoa of the father-god in heaven. Thus the lamentation ceremonies were intended to rejuvenate the dormant penis of the fertility deity. The common Hebrew word for lamentation is qinah, used for a particularly compulsive rhythm of three heavy beats followed by an "echo" of two more. The word comes from the Sumerian GTNA, "erect", coalescing into one word GIN, with the same meaning. Followed by URA, "penis", it is found in Greek as kinura and in Hebrew as kinnor, "harp" or "lyre", properly, then, the musical instrument which had the power of causing sexual stimulation in the man, and in the god.2 The Hebrew kinnor was the harlot's instrument, according to Isaiah (23:16), had the sound of the "rumbling of the bowels" (Isa i6 :i) and was played by David to relieve the maniacal Saul (I Sam 16: i6, etc).</p>
   <p>If, in historical times, the vocal efforts of the kinura players could be considered melodious, ritual lamentation was not originally designed to appeal to the musical ear. One of the Sumerian titles for the lamentation priest was 1-LU—BALAG—DI, the latter part of which, meaning "penis-stirrer", has a Semitic equivalent meaning "screech, roar, wail", and is found in Arabic as the title of the peacock, "The Screecher". This Semitic root is itself derived from a Sumerian phrase meaning "hurricane", so we may assume that part of the idea of ritual lamentation was to imitate the storm-wind howling to its crescendo, an indication that the fertility god in the heavens was approaching his mighty orgasm and ejaculation.3</p>
   <p>Presumably screaming was reckoned to have some erotic effect, and psychologically there may be some connection here with the extraordinary noise produced by teenage fans of pop-singers. The use of such tactics by female seducers of the Mandrake has perhaps found recognition in the long-standing tradition that when the magic plant is dragged from the ground it gives a demoniacal shriek.4</p>
   <p>The root of kinura, "lyre", and its cognates appears in Greek mythology as the name of the king of Cyprus, Cinyras. He is said to have founded the cult of Aphrodite in that island, and his name is given to the Cinyrades, priests of the Aphrodite—Astarte fertility cult in Paphos.</p>
   <p>Cinyras is also reputed to have introduced sacred prostitution into Cyprus, and to have been a musician.5</p>
   <p>The same idea of sexual stimulation appears in other musical terms, and in general where "praising" the god is involved. Indeed, our word "music", as one of the arts of the Greek Muses, has at heart the Sumerian phrase for "raising the heart" which elsewhere indicates sexual stimulation.6 In the classical world, the god Dionysus shares honours with his adoptive brother Apollo as "leader of the Muses". Another of his epithets was Dithurambos, Dithyramb, the original meaning of which has long been a mystery. It comes to be used of a Dionysiac song which possessed some infectious quality that led his votaries to take it up as a ritual chant. Later it became the subject for competition at Dionysiac festivals, and with its formalization it lost any spontaneity it may have possessed originally. Surviving fragments of the dithyramb show nothing to suggest its original connection with this fertility deity and his attributes.</p>
   <p>However, it is now clear from its Sumerian source that "dithyramb" fits philologically into the pattern of other cultic musical terms, meaning literally, "chant for erection of the penis".7 Incidentally this serves to confirm the opinion of the second-century writer Athenaeus that the god and this epithet Dithurambos were connected with the phallic deity Priapus, from whose name comes our word "priapism" or "erection of the penis".8 It also confirms the suggestion that the Greek dithurambos is of the same root as the Latin triumpus, our "triumph".9 This term was properly used of the victory procession through the capital city which was accorded a victorious general on his return from war. The wooden replica of the phallus which adorned his chariot emphasized the essentially virile nature of the "triumph". 10</p>
   <p>The original significance of the Dithyramb is of some importance for the nature and origin of Dionysiac music, and, indeed, for the history of tragedy generally. At the beginning of the fifth century BC, tragedy formed part of the Great Dionysia, the Spring festival of Dionysus Eleuthereus. Three poets competed, each contributing three tragedies and one satyric play. The latter was performed by choruses of fifty singers in a circle, dressed as satyrs, part human, part bestial, and bearing before them huge replicas of the erect penis, as they sang dithyrambs. The Greek word tragoidia, "tragedy", has been connected with tragos, "goat", either because the satyr chorus wore goat—skins, or because a goat was the prize offered the successful competitors. In fact, the "goat" reference of the word is secondary; its prime significance as the Sumerian original now shows, was a "lament raised to stimulate fecundity"." Thus the original intention of the tragedy, the singing of ritual laments and dithyrambs, was erotic.</p>
   <p>One name by which Dionysus was known throughout the ancient world was Bacchus. A fourth-century BC hymn in honour of Dionysus contains the invocation: "Come to us, King Dithyramb, Bacchus, god of the holy chant."12 The name Bacchus, Greek bak — khos, Latin bacchus is a shortened form of the Sumerian *BALAG_USh, "erect penis", made by assimilating the middle 1 to the following consonant. The word BALAG is made up of two elements, BAL, "borer", and AGA, "crown", so the whole properly meant the tip of the penis, the glans, or, in other circumstances, the boring bit of a drill.'3</p>
   <p>The same loss of the / occurred in certain derivative forms. Thus, directly connected with erotic "lamentation", Hebrew developed a verbal root b — k — h, "weep, bewail", so that, for example, Ezekiel's Tammuz—lamenters are mebakkoth, a feminine participle of this verb. Latin, on the other hand, preserved the land gave us our word "plague", properly a "stroke", from plango, "beat (the breast, head, in lamentation), weep, bewail"</p>
   <p>In extant Sumerian texts BALAG, "penis" is used specifically for the erotic instrument itself, prefaced or followed with the word for the instrumentalist, NAR, "eroticist".14 Her counterpart in Greek was the pallakis, Latin pellex, Hebrew pilegesh, where the word had come to mean, generally, concubine, or simply, young woman</p>
   <p>The female votaries of the phallus god Bacchus tere known as the Bacchantes, that is, those whose cult centred on the BALAG-AN-TA the "raised mushroom/penis". 16 They were characterized by extreme forms of religious excitement interspersed with periods of intense depression. At one moment whirling in a frenzied dance, tossing their heads, driving one another on with screaming and the wild clamour of musical instruments,'? at another sunk into the deepest lethargy, and a silence so intense as to become proverbial.'8 The Bacchantes both possessed the god and were possessed by hi; thmeirs was a religious enthusiasm in the proper sense of the term, that is, "god—filled".'9 Having eaten the Bacchus or Dionysus, they took on his power and character as the Christians "carried in their bodies the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus might be manifested in their bodies" (II Cor 4:10). As the Old Testament put it, by eating of the fruit of the tree of life, the initiates had become "like one of us", the gods (Gen 3:22).</p>
   <p>Outsiders were forbidden on pain of death from attending the secret rites, as Pentheus found to his cost in the myth on which Euripides based his tragedy, The Bacchae. So traditional accounts of the details of the Dionysiac, like any other mysteries, are bound to be somewhat distorted if not purely imaginary. This is particularly so in the all-important matter of the identity of the sacred meal through which the mystic union between god and worshipper was achieved. What we now know to have been the Amanita muscaria, is traditionally referred to as "fawns" or "little children", supposed to have been pulled asunder and eaten raw while the blood was still warm. The fact is that one of the names of the mushroom was "fawn" or "gazelle", so called mainly from a similarity seen between the large, round, shining eyes of these animals (from which the name "gazelle" is derived), and the top of the mushroom.20 The biblical Song of Songs, which we can now begin to understand as a dramatic ode to the sacred mushroom and its seeker, describes the Shulammite in such terms: "your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle" (Song of Sol 4:5, 7:3 [Heb. 4]).21 Another animal closely connected with the god and his votaries is the panther. In this case it is the colour and markings of the skin that is the subject of comparison, corresponding to the dusky-red and white or yellowish spots of the Amanita muscaria, and even more to the closely related Amanita pantherina whose name is similarly derived.22</p>
   <p>The "little children" reputed to have been torn apart by the raving Bacchantes will be of the same category as those "slain among the wadies, under the cleft rocks" by Isaiah's "sons of witches" who sought for "smooth things" by pouring out to them drink and cereal offerings (Isa 57:5, 6). We have seen the use of this substitution—word previously in the Accadian incantation to the kukru — resin of the pine tree, whose "little ones", or "pine—cones", the cultic prostitutes had "en— gendered".23</p>
   <p>The same kind of distortion of facts in relation to secret fertility cults can be seen actually in operation in the Old Testament traditions. Towards the end of the seventh century BC the young King Josiah tried to purge Jerusalem Of the old fertility worship. Among his acts of desecration was the defilement of Topheth "which is in the valley of the sons of Hinnom, that no one might bum his son or his daughter as an offering to Molech" (II Kgs 23:10).</p>
   <p>Jeremiah also speaks of this Molech cult when he says of the wayward people of Jerusalem:</p>
   <p>"They built the high places of Baal in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to offer up their Sons and daughters to Molech..."(Jer 32:35).</p>
   <p>The commentators have drawn horrifying pictures for us of wicked men pushing little Solly and Rachel on to the funeral pyre outside Jerusalem's south wall for the benefit of this pagan deity Molech. The clue to what was really intended, and indeed, what was probably written in the first editions of Kings and Jeremiah, is to be found in the corresponding passage in the Law. It appears in the context of regulations about sexual "perversions", mainly concerning the degrees of family relationship within which the man may not have intercourse, mother, mother-in-law, sister, granddaughter, and soon. It goes on:</p>
   <p>You shall not give your seed to devote it to Molech. You shall not commit sodomy. You shall not commit buggery, and neither shall any woman have sexual relations with a beast; it is perversion (Lev i8 :21—23).</p>
   <p>The English versions fall into the same trap as did the early redactors of II Kings and Jeremiah. The Leviticus prohibition does not say "you shall not devote your children to Molech", but, literally, "your seed", that is, your spermatozoa. The word "seed" can of course be extended to mean offspring, but the context shows that the burden of the law is that you should not pollute the god-given semen, after which Yahweh was named, by misusing it either in the anus of another male or genitals of an animal, or, in some way, by using it in the worship of the Molech. The name Molech is philologically related to that group of mucilaginous herbs called "Mallow", to the magic plant Moly, and the Greek Mukes, "mushroom". The root of all lies in the idea of the erect penis, so we may reasonably infer that the practice here objected to involved the dedication in some way of human semen in a phallic rite probably connected with the sacred fungus.24 In the awful silence that fell over the Bacchanal periodically, made more profound doubtless by its contrast with the maniacal raving preceding it, we may have a clue to another of the curious features of Essenism reported by Josephus. "No clamour or disturbance ever pollutes their dwelling;" he says, "they speak in turn, each making way for his neighbour. To persons outside the silence of those within appears like some awful mystery •." The explanation he offers, that the limitation of their rations to bare necessities imposed a restriction upon their efforts, hardly justifies his praise for their self—discipline, nor adequately accounts for the profound silence that seems, to the outsider like an "awful mystery". Nearer the truth, probably, is the comment of one scholar on the "Bacchic silence": "Is it", he asks, "the exhaustion that follows upon over-exaltation, or is it the very zenith reached by the fight of the spirit when voices and sounds are hushed, and in rapt silence the soul feels closest to God? That this was a method for attaining the highest and deepest communion was known to the ancient theosophists, and this mysterious proverb suggests that it may have been known to the followers of the wild Thracian god."26</p>
   <p>In fact, there was a more clinical reason for the Bacchic lethargy. The poisons contained in the cap of the Amanita muscaria promote periods of intense excitement, accompanied by delirium, hallucinations, and great animation, but these are followed by periods of deep depression. To quote one witness to Amanita muscaria intoxication: "The person intoxicated by Fly—Agaric (a popular name for the Amanita muscaria) sits quietly rocking from side to side, not even taking part in the conversation with his family. Suddenly his eyes dilate, he begins to gesticulate convulsively, converses with persons whom he imagines he sees, sings and dances. Then an interval of rest sets in again.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, the Bacchanalian characteristic of uninhibited excitement succeeded by calm, was not a mere accident of drug therapy. Eating the god made it possible to induce and to some extent control an experience which was fundamental to fertility philosophy. The repeated bouts of drug-stimulated excitement were in the nature of violent and unnaturally prolonged sexual orgasms, whether or not they resulted in erection and ejaculation on the part of the men or spasmodic vaginal contractions by the women. As coitus is usually followed by sleep and a mildly depressive state of mind, so every Bacchic frenzy was followed by a time of calm. Emotionally, and perhaps spiritually, these periods of physical relaxation were as essential to the mystic experience of the Dionysus worshipper as to the acts of human love. They were equally as necessary to the fertility cycle of the natural world. As sleep follows coitus, and a fresh—scented peace succeeds the storm, so too the land lies fallow after the "birth" of harvest. The Jewish mythologists traced their obligatory rest—day, the Sabbath ("heart's easement"),28 back to their god's resting from his creative labours when he made the world (Gen 2:2f.). But the Hebrew agriculturalist recognized a regular sabbatical rhythm in nature requiring a sabbath year after every six, when the fields might rest fallow to recoup their strength and restore the essential balance (Lev 2$;3f.). After forty—nine years, the "heart's easement" applied to every side of human experience, familial, economic, as well as agricultural (Lev 25:8—17). Perhaps as the pace of life increases we shall one day have to insist on all human beings reappropriating this sabbatical year principle of the fertility philosophy and applying it like the Hebrew JubiLee to every aspect of our family, economic, and social lives.</p>
   <p>The raising of the sacred fungus, then, necessitated the use of "cultic prostitutes" whose bodily excretions and sexual fascination were thought to engender the "little children". Compensation was required if the balance of nature were not to be impaired when the Holy Plant was lifted from the earth. But these atoning sacrifices required no less the grace of the god, so that acceptance of his supreme gift required further sacrifice on his part.</p>
   <p>The ritualistic lamentation which marked ceremonies devoted to the raising of the sacred mushroom, was erotic in character, as, apparently, was all music and drama in its original intent. The female votaries of the god Bacchus were the prime exponents of the fungus cult in the ancient world, and in their orgiastic excitement interspersed with periods of extreme lethargy, we see reflected the rhythms of sexual and agricultural experience.</p>
   
   <h2>XI. The Mushroom "Egg" and Birds of Mythology</h2>
   <p>As the virgin goddess plays an important part in fertility cults throughout the ancient world, so the virgin volva of the sacred mushroom, her real-life counterpart of Nature, figures largely in fungus nomenclature and mythology. Yet the mushroom is in some respects a hermaphrodite, displaying characteristics of both sexes. With the stem at flu stretch, as we have seen, the Amanita muscaria seemed to the ancients like an erect, fiery—topped penis. 1 But if the volva is sliced open before it splits of its own accord, there will be found inside a fully formed mushroom waiting to expand, like a foetus in a womb, or a chick in an egg (fig. 4). It is small wonder, then, that the mushroom was spoken of as a "womb" and many of its folk-designations and imagery come from this concept.</p>
   <p>One such name we have already noticed in Paeony, the Holy Plant, and, in mythological terms, "Peter, Bar—jona". Using the same Sumerian element in the last part of that word, *IA_u_NA, "fertility; womb", and prefaced with the Sumerian word GIG, "shade, protection", there came into Semitic the name qiqlyJn, "pod—plant", used for Jonah's mushroom sun-shade.2 That same word in Hebrew represented also a plant of a quite different kind but which also had pod-or womb- like fruits containing the laxative with which nursery tummy-upsets have made us all too familiar, castor oil. Our English translators of the Jonah story have sometimes had the unfortunate prophet seeking shade from the sun under a Castor oil tree. Our word "uterus" comes ultimately from a Sumerian phrase *USh_TAR with the same meaning. A fuller form of "Bar-jona" combined *BARUNA with *USh TAR to make the Greek name of the Holy Plant, Peristeredn3 which became most important for mushroom mythology in the Greek-speaking world and particularly in the New Testament. The old botanists not unnaturally connected the name with the "dove", Greek peristera, thinking the Holy Plant must have been the natural habitat for these birds. In fact, the connection is much more direct. The bird's name in Greek, as its equivalent yonab in Semitic (Jonah's name is the same word), actually means "womb"; the reference to the bird is secondary.4</p>
   <p>A number of birds are, like the dove, connected in ancient nomenclature and mythology with fertility and the womb, and thus with the mushroom. The dove is traditionally associated with peace, the word for which in both Greek and Semitic has an underlying significance of "fertility" and "fruitfulness". In Hebrew the delightful word, shlJm, is used, like its Arabic equivalent, saldm, as a traditional greeting, "Peace!" But it is more than not being at war with anything or anybody; it has, like the sound of the word itself, a sense of being replete, content, in the terms of the old fertility philosophy, in a state of balance with yourself and the world. Those people of the ancient Near East who gave us our culture, would have viewed our concern with the Pill with incredulity. The barren womb was a plague from the god; a</p>

   </p>
   <p>4 Diagrammatic section of (i) a volva before "birth" (ii) a mature mushroom</p>
   <p>woman without a foetus in her belly was an insult to her sex and her man. In that house there could be no shalom, no "peace"</p>
   <p>The dove symbolized fruitfulness. As Nature is composed of opposites, and as the foetus is born of the white sperm of the male and the dark red blood of the female,6 so the white dove has its counterpart in the black raven. Its name also can be traced back in Greek and Semitic to the womb idea,7 and it too was traditionally associated with fertility. The Greeks invoked the raven at weddings, and there was a curious idea that, like the dove, the raven laid its eggs or mated through its beak.8 Pliny poured scorn on the idea, and thought it was just a way of kissing. Nevertheless, he quotes the "old wives' tale" that pregnant women should avoid eating ravens' eggs lest they bear their children through their mouths. It was the same observation of the manner of courtship of these birds that led the Romans to call a man who indulged in labial kissing during sex-play, a "crow".</p>
   <p>It was a raven that was sent out first from Noah's ark to survey the flooded world, and it was a dove sent out later that brought back evidence of new growth in its beak (Gen 8 :61f.). In the Old Testament account of the Creation, the spirit of God hovers like a bird above the primeval sea, wafting with its wing-beat the breath of God into the slime from which the world was made (Gen 1:2). So Pliny speaks of "that famous breath (spiritus) that generates the universe by fluctuating to and fko as in a kind of wonib".l° It is much the same imagery that portrays the Holy Spirit fluttering down on the head of Jesus at his baptism (Matt 3:16), making him, too, a "Bar.jona", "Son of a Dove"</p>
   <p>Another important example of the winged creature-fertility motif in the Old Testament is the idea of the cherubim. The modern popular image of the cherub as a rosy-cheeked and under-clad infant with diminutive wings owes more to late artistic conceptions of post- biblical Jewish angelology than the Old Testament. There the cherub is pictured as a strange hybrid creature, having two, four or six wings (counting Isaiah's "seraphim" as of the same order) and one, two or four heads, human and bestial. Yahweh rides upon a cherub, "swiftly upon the wings of the wind" (Ps 18:io [Heb. ix] II Sam 22:11), and is "the one enthroned upon the cherubim" (I Sam 4:4, etc). This last figure refers to the throne of Yahweh in the Holy of Holies of the Jerusalem temple where two cherubim stand on either side of an arched canopy 11 ("mercy—seat") over the ark of the testimony (Exod 25: i7ff.). The outstretched wings of the cherubim form Yahweh's throne, and it is there that the god promises to meet Moses and his high priestly successors for oracular consultation.</p>
   <p>The cherubim are here exercising a protective function as they do in the Garden of Eden (Gen 3:24), scene of the primeval creation. Similarly, Ezekiel speaks of them as the "screening cherubim of the anointing" in God's garden (28:1 3f.). In classical mythology the counterpart of the biblical cherubim are the griffins who guard a source of treasure near a cave called "the Earth's Doorbolt", the entrance into the womb of mother Earth. 12 Like the cherub, the griffin is pictured bearing the god on its back, and drawing the chariot of the fertility goddess Aphrodite with her charioteer Eros.'3</p>
   <p>Ezekiel, and following him late Jewish mysticism, makes much of the cherubim and related chariot imagery. To the prophet, in some form of hallucinatory trance, they appear as grotesque apparitions in a storm, surrounded by flashes of lightning and roars of thunder (Ezek 1:4,24). They move not only on outstretched wings but with whirling, eye—studded wheels, having in them the "spirit of life", and they bear the glory of Yahweh from the Temple porch (chs. i, io). Above their heads is a canopy and beneath it their wings are spread, two for flying and two to cover their bodies (Ezek i:6, 23).</p>
   <p>The mushroom imagery is here dramatically evident. The prophet sees the Amanita muscaria, its glowing red cap studded with the white flakes of the broken pellicle from the volva. In this skin lies the hallucinatory drug, one of whose properties is to enhance the perceptive faculties, making colours brighter and objects far larger or smaller than their real size.'4</p>
   <p>Philologically, also, the cherub-griffin is related to the fungus. The names in Indo-European and Semitic go back to another "pod-" or "womb-" word, *GtJIUB, similar in meaning to the source of the name of the well-known pod-plant, the Carob.'5 It was this Carob that supplied the horn-or uterus-shaped pods eaten by the Prodigal Son (Luke 15:16). Pliny described them as "not longer than a man's finger, occasionally curved like a sickle, with the thickness of a man's thumb".'6 The name had another reference in the ancient world, however. The Accadian botanists use the same Semitic word for Carob to describe the Sumerian "Seed—of—life" plant, the mushroom. 17</p>
   <p>The association between birds and the womb must have been in part due to the similarity seen between the chick in its pellicle of the egg and the foetus in the uterine membrane, just as Pliny drew a parallel between the baby mushroom in its "volva" and the chick in the egg. But for the idea of the outstretched wings of the womb-birds like the cherub- griffin, one should look to the fancied resemblance between the wings and the so-called "horns" of the uterus, the Fallopian tubes, which branch out from the top and terminate in the ovaries. A stylization of this kind appears in the Egyptian hieroglyph representing the bicornate uterus of the heifer, It was this kind of imagery which brought together the name of the palm-tree, Phoenix, with the most famous of all the "womb-birds" of mythology. The relationship of the palm- tree, with its long stem surmounted by a canopy of leaves, and the mushroom, will be discussed later,'9 but the similarity between them both and the stylized uterus will be immediately evident.</p>
   <p>The Phoenix bird was for centuries a favourite theme of mythology and philosophers, pagan and Christian.20 It was believed to burn itself alive on its own nest at the end of an extremely long life, and from its body or ashes which had become fertilized there came forth another Phoenix. This offspring was, in some versions, created from the beginning a perfect replica of its parent, or, according to other reports, grew from a preliminary larval stage, like a grub. The Phoenix-bird mythology is another piece of mushroom folklore. 2' As the foetus is generated in the furnace of the uterus, so the mushroom, that "evil ferment of the soil", as Nicander (second century BC) calls it,22 is created, a "womb" within a "womb", as it were. Like the fabulous Phoenix, the mushroom is self-generated and regenerated, bursting forth from the volva, only to die as quickly and then apparently miraculously to reappear, a resurrection of its own self. A great deal of the mythology of the ancient Near East hinges on the theme of the dying and rising god. It is usually, and correctly, seen as symbolism in story form of the processes of nature whereby in the heat of summer the earth's greenness disappears in death, to reappear the following spring in new birth. But, as we shall see, in the life cycle of the mushroom this natural cycle was quickened to a matter of days or even hours.23 The fungus was a microcosm of the whole fertility process, the essence of god compressed into the womb and penis of the hermaphrodite mushroom.</p>
   <p>It was long ago suggested that the Phoenix bird was the stork, ever the type and emblem of maternal and filial affection. The Latin name for this bird, ciconia is almost certainly derived from the Sumerian</p>
   <p>*GIG-IA-U-NA, "pod of fertility", the Hebrew qiqaydn of Jonah's sunshade mushroom.24 That it was the shape motif that earned for the bird this mushroom name, seems to be indicated by the use of ciconia in Latin for a "T"-shaped implement for measuring the depth of furrows in the field, as if this were the obvious characteristic of the bird as it stood on one leg, its body forming the "canopy"</p>
   <p>The swan is another of the fertility birds. Possibly its long curved neck seemed to represent the vaginal passage, whilst its white body was the uterus and its outstretched wings were the Fallopian tubes. The Greek and Latin names for the bird, through which we received our "cygnet", are pod-names, derived from a Sumerian *GUG...NU,25 "seed pod". In classical mythology, Zeus takes the form of a swan to mate with Leda, and from the union she was delivered of an egg from which came the heroine-goddess Helen and her twin brothers Castor and Pollux. The whole of this story is mushroom-inspired as we shall see, and the very common twin mythology of the ancient world comes directly out of the mushroom cult. When the egg or volva of the mushroom splits into two, one half is left in the ground, the other forced upwards by the expanding stem or phallus, borne aloft as a canopy towards the sky. In those simplified terms, anyway, the old myth-makers saw the development of the fungus, and from that conception they formulated many stories and characters having to do with twin-children, bearing names related to the "womb" and the "penis". When the offspring are combined into one person, like Adonis, Apollo, Dionysus, and so on, he is often pictured as a beautiful, rather effeminate youth, a favourite theme of the classical sculptors. On occasion, this person is a Hermaphrodite, a mixture of both sexes, the prime example of which was, as the name implies, the offspring of Hermes (Sumerian *ERUM..US1I, "erect penis")26 and Aphrodite (*A_BURU_DA_TI, "organ of fecundity", that is, the "womb").27 In the following chapter we shall look at some "twin" stories derived from the "hermaphrodite"28 mushroom, and at the symbolism it evoked.</p>

   <h2>XII. The Heavenly Twins</h2>
   <p>At first sight the portrayal of a fertility hero-deity like Apollo or Dionysus as a smooth-skinned, beardless stripling, almost girlish in features and deportment, seems to contradict their connections with sexuality and the fecundity of nature. Of a similar inconsistency are those "virgin" goddesses who seem to spend most of their time locked in copulatory embrace with husbands and lovers. Mercifully for our literary heritage, logic plays a very small part in religious mythology.</p>
   <p>In the case of the "twin" stories, it seems equally strange that the children are usually featured as both of the same sex, usually boys or men. Whether they represent the male or female aspect of the mushroom, the "penis" or the "womb", can only be determined by reference to the original meanings of their names (a discriminatory problem with which we today are not entirely unfamiliar). This we can now do, thanks to our being able to trace the names back to their Sumerian origin. Thus the biblical brothers, Cain and Abel, represent the "womb" and the "penis" respectively. The first name comes from the Sumerian *GAR...EN, "seed-container",1 and the second from BAL, "borer; phallus".2 A fuller form of Abel's name, including the word TI, "organ", "instrument", produced the biblical proper name Tubal— Cain, the patron of metal-working, son of Zillah (Gen 4:22).8</p>
   <p>These last references provide a good illustration of the way the Bible takes the fungus names of their heroes and heroines and provides the characters with their "parents" and "trades". Tubal— Cain's mother is Zillah, which, in the Aramaic-speaking community in which these stories must have originated, would have meant that he could be called "Bar—Zillah", that is "son of Zillah". The Semitic word for "iron" (properly "axe—head") is barzeW, so naturally Tubal—Cain is a "metalworker". The mushroom reference is to another meaning of barzela', "womb", actually the female "groin" (Sumerian *B14fl_sIL(A), the "junction" of the body, where the legs meet the trunk, or, in the case of the "axe", where the haft is inserted in the "V"— shaped head). So two names for the fungus, the combined Tubal-Cain and barzela' are spun out by the biblical myth-makers into a hero, his mother's name, and his trade.4 The ancient botanists give us an androgynous plant-name Eryngion (Greek Eruggion), in which we can now recognize "Hermes" (ERUM) (the phallus) and "Cain" (the womb).5 Pliny says of this plant:</p>
   <p>Marvellous is the characteristic reported of it, that its root grows into the likeness of one sex or the other. It is rarely so found, but should the male form come into the possession of men, they become lovable in the eyes of women. This, it is said, is how Phaon ofLesbos won the love of Sappho, there being much idle trifling on the subject not only among the Magi, but also among the Pythagoreans.6</p>
   <p>Among its many reputed therapeutic properties, the Eryngion was said to correct "a deficiency or excess in menstruation, and all affections of the uterus".7 It was also known as Hermaion, referring simply to the first element in its name, ERUM, "penis"; "Hermes". Another phallic name of the plant was Moly, properly the "knobbed-plant",8 a common designation of the magic fungus in mythology.</p>
   <p>Eryngion also appears among the names given the Aloe, otherwise called Amphibion, "double— life".9 The prophet Tiresias was said to have been "amphibious" because he lived both as man and woman; 10 so perhaps our fashion designers have found themselves a new word in place of "uni—sex". Pliny says of the Aloe that its bulbous root resembles a Squill, "the root is single, as it were a stake sunk into the ground".ll That is, the androgynous herb had a bulb (volva) and a phallic stem.</p>
   <p>It may be that we should fmd in the double-sexed Eryngion, in whatever form the name appeared in Semitic, a name of the mushroom and the origin of one part of the Cain and Abel story. After Cain had slain his brother Abel, Yahweh condemns him to be a fugitive and wanderer on the earth (Gen 4:12). Cain complains bitterly that his punishment is more than he can bear. Being an outcast, without tribal protection, he will be at the mercy of all: "Whoever finds me will kill me". "Not so", replies Yahweh, "Every slayer-of—Cain (horeg — Qa yin) will be subject to a seven— fold vengeance." The Hebrew phrase is strongly reminiscent of our bi-sexual plant name Eryngion (*ERUM_ GAR-EN; Greek Eruggion).12</p>
   <p>Incidentally, another phrase in that story is a similarly contrived play on the name of the mushroom, still in use today. After the murder, when Yahweh is looking for Abel, he demands of Cain, "Where is Abel, thy brother?" The miscreant replies rather petulantly with a question which has become a byword in discussions on the social responsibility of the individual: "Am I my brother's keeper (shomer —</p>
   <p>Even now in Persia the mushroom is known as samJrukh, which is traceable to a Sumerian *ShU_MAR_UGU/AGA, "crown of the womb-favourer", that is the "glans" or top of the fungus. 13</p>
   <p>The most famous of all twins in classical mythology are Castor and Pollux. They were born from an egg, the fruit of their mother's union with Zeus, who appeared to her in the form of a swan. 14 Their sister was Helen, 15 connected as we saw earlier, with the resin of the conifer, source of the Amanita muscaria, as was believed. 16 The mushroom affinities of the twins are therefore well established.</p>
   <p>The two lads are known jointly as the "Dioscouroi", which the classical writers took to be a dual form of a Greek phrase dioskouros, "son of god". They therefore called the lads, "the sons of Zeus". 17 In actual fact, their name is not a plural form, or even Greek. It is ajumbled Sumerian title, *ush...Gu.4J_TJ], "erect phallus of the storm". The Greek rearrangement of the various verbal elements began with *ud_ ush — gu — ri became *di_us_ku...roi, and thus to Dioskoroi or, as it is otherwise written in the texts, Dioskouroi.18</p>
   <p>We know their name in the rather more accurately transmitted form of USh-GU—RI—UD, "Iscariot", the name of Jesus' betrayer in the New Testament story. 19 Elsewhere, the writers and theologians read the name Dioscouroi in the manner of the classicists, by splitting a presumed singular into two, "son of God", as a title for their hero Jesus. Interestingly, the Sumerian original has come down into Persian as another name of the mushroom, saqratiyiin.2° The name Castor is cognate with the Greek gaster, "belly, womb" (our "gastric", etc)21 and it is from the more general sense of "pod" that the name came to be applied to the plant from whose pods comes the medicament, castor_oil.22 We have already noticed how this wider "pod" significance has led biblical commentators to wonder how Jonah found shade from the sun under the Castor-oil bush.23 A similar misunderstanding underlies the widespread belief among the ancients that this valuable medicine could be obtained from the testicles of the beaver (Latin castor):</p>
   <p>The beavers of the Black Sea region [writes Pliny], practise self-amputation (of the testicles) when beset by danger, as they know they are hunted for the sake of its secretion, the medical name for which is "beaver oil" (castoreum). Apart from this the beaver is an animal with a formidable bite, cutting down trees on the river banks as if with iron; if it gets hold of part of a man's body it does not relax its bite before the fractured bones are heard grinding together.</p>
   <p>So Nicander speaks of "the testicle that is fatal to the beaver".25 The confusion here is between the "seed-bag" of the male, the testicle or "egg",20 and the woman's uterus, "foetus-container". But the reference to cutting down trees, accurate enough of the riverside animal, may also contain an allusion to the fungus whose presence on broken and rotting wood must have seemed proof of the same destructive powers as were possessed by the beaver. One may also conjecture that the added note about having once gripped "part of a man's body" it would not release its hold, has originated from a piece of earthy humour concerning the female organ.</p>
   <p>Pollux was the strong man. His name is a somewhat jumbled form of the Sumerian phrase LU-GEShPU, "strong man", and so "guardian, jailor", from which also was derived the Greek phulax, of just that meaning.27 In mythology Pollux is depicted as a "boxer, one good with his fists", the picture thus presented being that of the forearm and clenched fist, with the same phallic allusions as were implied in the Services' term for the penis, "short arm".28 The development of the name Pollux and the Greek phulax from the Sumerian LU-GEShPU has a particular interest for us. The last syllable PU was detached and placed before the rest of the phrase, giving pu-I u-gesh, and thus brought into its derived forms (the longer Greek form of the twin's name, Poludeukes, comes from the same original to which a word DU, "adversary" has been added, in full *LU_GBShPU_DU).</p>
   <p>It is this same GEShPU, "strong man", (the preformative LU simply indicates the meaning "man" for what follows) which forms the main part of the New Testament name for the brothers James and John, "Boanerges".29 The whole Sumerian phrase from which the Greek nickname comes was *GEShPU...AN...UR (read as pu-an-ur-ges) meaning "mighty man (holding up) the arch of heaven", a fanciful image of the stem supporting the canopy of the mushroom, seen in cosmographical terms. In a later chapter we shall deal in more detail with mushroom cosmography generally, based upon a view of the universe which saw heaven and earth as born from the volva of some vast primeval fungus.</p>
   <p>The name "Boanerges" has given scholars a lot of trouble in the past.30 For one thing it has been assumed to be Aramaic, a kind of semijocular nickname applied to the fiery-tempered brothers by Jesus in the colloquial Aramaic of Palestine of the first century, but which is incomprehensible in any known Aramaic dialect. The text adds the "explanation" of the name as "Sons of Thunder" (Mark 3 :I7). Again, it has been assumed that the reference is to the brothers' suggestion that they call fire down upon the Samaritan village that would not receive the Master and his friends (Luke 9:54). The trouble has been that "Boanerges" does not, and in that form cannot mean "Sons of Thunder". For one thing the first part "Boane —" is not the Semitic bne-, "sons of, even though it sounds something like it; for another, the remaining part, — rges does not mean "thunder".32 All the same, the whole phrase has an air of authenticity which might deceive the cursory reader, and this was certainly its intention. Its real import was a secret name of the mushroom, found otherwise in "Pollux" and in other terms with the same meaning of an upholder of a heavenly canopy.</p>
   <p>We have too readily assumed, in seeking an explanation for the strange incompatibility between "Boanerges" and its "translation", that the text was defective, that later scribes being unfamiliar with Aramaic had miswritten the nickname. Now, thanks to our present discoveries, we are able to take a more appreciative view of the craft of the New Testament cryptographer. Neither he nor his copyists had made a mistake; we had, in taking the text at its face value. The name was not a jocular expression given by an Aramaic-speaking rabbi to two of his friends. It is not, as we now realize, Aramaic. The clue to its mushroom affinities has lain all along in the "translation" which, as such, is of course quite spurious. But "sons of thunder" is a well-known name for the fungus, found elsewhere in Semitic texts, and supported by the old Greek name keraunion, "thunder— fungus", after keraunos, "thunder".33 The reference is to the belief that mushrooms were born of thunder, the voice of the god in the storm, since it was noticed that they appeared in the ground after rainstorms. Later, we shall have to look again at this "Boanerges-Sons of Thunder" group, for it is a particularly clear example of a number of such instances in the text of the New Testament where a genuine mushroom name is followed by a spurious translation for the sake of the plot of the story. As here, the false renderings have usually some particular relevance for the sacred fungus, even though they do not interpret, as they affirm, the accompanying foreign word. What they do indicate very clearly is the unreal nature of the whole surface story of the Gospels and Acts. Put very simply, if the writer has gone to the trouble purposefully to conceal his secret name for the mushroom by giving it a misleading rendering, near enough in this case to deceive the cursory reader, then it follows that behind the story of Jesus and his companions there lies a secret layer of meaning which was not intended to be read or understood by the outsider. Since mushrooms nowhere appear in the surface story, and yet are clearly involved in the cryptic names, it must mean that the secret level of understanding is the significant one for the intended reader as for the cryptographer; what appears on the sur&amp;ce is unreal and never expected to be taken seriously by those within the cult. There is no escape from this dilemma: if our new understanding of "Boanerges" is correct, the historicity and validity of the New Testament story is in ruins. A subterfuge of this nature, bearing as it does on what we now see was a widespread and very ancient mushroom cult, can only mean that the "real" Christianity was heavily involved with it; in which case the story of Jesus was a hoax for the benefit of the Jewish and Roman authorities engaged in persecuting the cult. We shall give this matter more extended consideration later.4 To go back to Pollux: he represents the phallic side of the mushroom figure, the support to the upper half of his brother Castor's "womb". For when the mushroom canopy is fully spread, a new picture emerges, and one of particular importance for New Testament symbolism. This spread canopy was the upper half of the volva, so it was natural to envisage the stem as a human phallus supporting the open groin of the woman. In other terms, the shaft had been driven home into the axe- head, in this fashion: '-</p>
   <p>This configuration of an upright supporting an apex or fork came to have a profound sexual significance. The upright was the strong arm or erect penis supporting the "burden" of the womb. The very word "burden" in Sumerian GUN, came down through Latin cunnus into our presently impolite designation of the female genitals, "cunt".5 The "organ of burden", AR-GUN, appears dialectaily in the name of Mount Hermon,36 the Canaanite version of 01ympus,37 supporter of the heavenly arch.</p>
   <p>Even trees having a broad comus like an enlarged mushroom were vested with sexual powers. The Plane tree38 has had this significance from the beginning of recorded history. It was its shade that tempted the Sumerian goddess manna, wearied from her long travels, to sleep awhile. It stood in the garden of one Shukallituda, who found the lovely goddess sleeping and could not resist the temptation she offered. When she awoke to the discovery that she had not slept alone, she laid a terrible curse upon the land. The earth and wells were inundated with blood, like the land and river of Egypt when Pharaoh refused to let the Israelites leave (Exod 17: i7ff.).</p>
   <p>The woman, because of her vulva, what harm she did! manna because of her womb, what she did do! All the wells of the land she filled with blood...39</p>
   <p>Similarly, it was in the shade of the Plane tree that Zeus made love to Europa, after he had carried her to Crete from the mainland in the guise of a magnificent white bull.40 The Hebrew name for the Plane tree, 'armon comes ultimately from the same Sumerian phrase AR-GUN as gave the name of the mountain Hermon.41 Our own word "harmony", too, comes from the same source, for the word means properly "ajoining together" the matching of the bearer and the burden. One who does this in carpentry is a "harmonizer".42 He makes the hole and fits the joint; like Phereclus, the ship—builder, he is a Harmonides, "son of a carpenter".43 So, too, is Jesus called in the New Testament (Matt 13:55; cp. Mark 6:3), for the mushroom was seen as both the "drill" and the effected "joint".</p>
   <p>The ancient form of the drill was not unlike the mushroom in shape. In essentials it was a short rod surmounted by a bun-shaped whorl like a spindle for winding thread. At the lower end was the bit of iron or flint. We can see it so represented in the Egyptian hieroglyphs as and. The Sumerian ideogram for "carpenter" is ,46 the notched whorl in this case being to take the string of the bow that gave the instrument its spin. The male organ is the "borer" into the vagina, and the Latin phallus comes from the Sumerian BAL, "borer",47 which also designates the weaver's spindle (ideogram +48) and the mushroom. When the penis slides into the vagina, or the shaft into the axe—head,4° "harmony" has been achieved, and the ancients saw the extended mushroom as representing that happy state. Now that we can understand the sexual significance to the ancient mind of the inverted "V" formation, it is possible to appreciate why it was from Adam's rib that his partner was made:</p>
   <p>The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for the man there was not found a helper to suit him. So Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place. And the rib that he had taken from the man he built up into a woman, and he brought her to the man... (Gen 2 :20f.).</p>
   <p>The Hebrew name for "rib", sela' is the Sumerian SILA, represented by the "V" shape,5° and what the Old Testament writer clearly had in mind was a rib extending on both sides of the spinal column, giving the arched form associated with the open groin and the mushroom top. From this "rib" the god fashioned the significant part of the woman, supplying the canopy for the erect stem, and "harmony" for the hitherto deprived Adam.</p>
   <p>The inverted "V" shape, the angular representation of the mushroom cap, was also the form of the old yoke that was laid across the shoulders of the servant or animal. Again, it is the Sumerian GUN, "burden", that is at the base of our word "yoke" (through the Latin jugum, Greek zugon).51 In the extended mushroom " was seen an image of a neck bearing a yoke, and this idea came into the Twin mythology by portraying Castor as a "yoker" of horses, that is a horse—trainer.52 The "yoke" of a chariot was the cross-piece fastened to the central pole on either side of which the animals were fastened. At its very simplest, the traction end of the war chariot could be represented by a cross,. The Greek word harma, 'joining", like the Latin jugum, "yoke", could express "chariot", as could the Sumerian MAR, "axe- head; rainbow; and groin".53 From this "forked burden" came the sexual allusions of chariots and chariotry noticed earlier.54 To "drive a chariot" meant, then, to take an active role in the copulatory act. The sun is the great "charioteer" (Greek harmekter) of the heavens as it wheels across the sky and plunges into the vulva of mother earth at eventide. So Yahweh, the creator god, is seen riding upon the cherubim (Ps i8 :ii,55 etc) and, among the lesser heroes, Jehu "drove furiously" (II Kgs 9:20).</p>
   <p>The Greek word for "horse—driver" is elater. In derivation it is more related to the sexual affinities of the action than the equine, since it comes from the Sumerian E-LA-TUN, "strong water of the belly (womb)", that is, in its sexual application, "spermatozoa".56 As Elaterion we find it as the Greek name of the Squirting Cucumber, Ecballium elaterium, whose phallic shape and periodic exudation of a mucilaginous juice gave it sexual allusions57 which the modem Arab recognizes when he calls the plant, "donkey's cucumber".58 In actual fact the intensely bitter juice of the Elaterium is anything but productive of fertility, being a violent purge and an abortifacient.59 But like Hellebore, "strong water of defecation" as its Sumerian derivation shows the name to mean,60 the Squirting Cucumber gat hered to itself many names that belonged primarily to the Amanita muscaria, no less bitter and with similar gastronomic and intestinal effects. 6'</p>
   <p>In mythology the horse- and cattle-driving theme appears frequently. The newly-born Hermes leaps from his cradle and precociously drives away his half—brother Apollo's cattle.62 Castor fights with his cousins over their driving away cattle and is killed in the battle.68 The yoke laid across the neck of a servant or an animal or the upright pole of a carriage, had another, more sinister application. It was also the crux ("cross")64 oxfurca ("fork")65 that the criminal carried on his shoulders to his place of execution, his wrists fastened to each end. At the gallows, at this stage simply the upright set in the ground, the Greek stauros,66 the condemned man was hoisted up so that his legs were just clear of the ground and left there to die of exposure. To take some of the weight off the bonds at his wrists, the upright was sometimes provided with a horizontal peg to support the crutch, a kind of saddle (Latin sedile).66 a To "take up the yoke" or "cross" was thus synonymous with being crucified, and is a constant theme in the New Testament. It will also have been a euphemism for sexual copulation, the "yoke" being the "burden" of the woman's crutch borne gallantly by the erect penis. It is with this implication that the cross became the symbol of the phallic god Hermes. It consisted basically of an upright piece of wood with a cross—piece at the shoulders, and in its more sophisticated forms with an erect penis at an appropriate place on the shaft, indicating its phallic implications. Sometimes the top of the upright was carved with a two- faced representation of the god's head. The Hermes cross symbol was known throughout the classical world, and standing at crossroads was welcomed as a source of comfort and inspiration by the traveller.67 The similarity between this fertility symbol and the instrument of execution must have been obvious to all, even to the detail of the crutch- supporting sedile of the gallows finding its parallel in the replica phallus half—way up the Hermes upright. It is interesting that the eastern churches preserve this detail in their traditional form of the crucifix with the double cross-piece: t.</p>
   <p>Castor and Pollux were also represented by crossed wooden beams in Sparta,68 and the Greeks called the gibbet the "twin tree" (xulon didumon).69 The Twins also carried a cross or star on their heads, surmounting a close-fitting felt cap, as we may see from coins on which the brothers are represented: Y° Presumably this characteristic headgear was intended to represent the half-egg (Castor) of the mushroom and the stalk and canopy of Pollux. In Christian iconography this symbol became the orb , and the Sumerian ideogram for "fertility", ,71 may possibly have been expressing the same motif:</p>
   <p>The idea of crucifixion in mushroom mythology was already established before the New Testament myth-makers portrayed their mushroom hero Jesus dying by this method. The fungus itself was probably known as "The Little Cross",72 and in the Old Testament the seven sons of Saul had been crucified as an expiatory sacrifice to Yahweh. The story runs that a three-year famine in the land drove David to seek from Yahweh an explanation for his disfavour. The god told him that there was a blood—guilt on Israel because David's predecessor Saul had executed the Gibeonites. These deaths had to be expiated before the fertility of the land could be restored. Thereupon David called the Gibeonites who demanded the atoning death by crucifixion of Saul's seven sons, one of whose names was Armoni, "the joiner, carpenter".73 After the deed, Armoni's mother Rizpah (Hebrew r-z-p, "join")74 "took sackcloth and spread it for herself on the rock (of execution),from the beginning of the harvest until the rain fell upon them (the crucified) from heaven; and she did not allow the birds of the air to alight upon them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night" (II Sam 21 :io).</p>
   <p>Only after David had taken down the bodies and buried the remains, and those of Saul and Jonathan which had been similarly exposed, did "God allow himself to be entreated on the land's behalf (v. 14).75 The verb used in this gruesome tale for "crucify" means properly "disjoint".76 In the story of Jacob's wrestling match with the angel it expressed the dislocation of the hip-joint:</p>
   <p>When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and Jacob's thigh was put out ofjoint as he wrestled with him... therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, because he touched the hollow ofJacob's thigh on the sinew of the hip (Gen 32:25, 32).</p>
   <p>The "hip" motif is a recurrent theme in mushroom mythology. Adonis-Na'iman was killed, according to legend, by being run through the hip by a boar, sent, some say, by Artemis from jealousy. Dionysus, often connected with Adonis, was said to have been born from the hip of his father Zeus. His mother Semele, an earth-goddess, had been impregnated by the Father-god, but before her son could be born, she was struck by a thunderbolt. Her divine lover snatched the foetus from her womb and implanted it in his own hip, from which in due course the young Dionysus was born.77</p>
   <p>Again, as Jesus hangs on the cross, a soldier runs him through the side with his spear (John 19:34). The resultant wound made a mark large enough for the doubting Thomas to put his fist in (John 20:25, 27). In all these references, the allusion is to the ball—and—socket picture presented by the hip-joint, by the head of the penis in the female vagina, or, as was fancifully imagined, by the stem in the cap of the mushroom, 78 and the separation of the one from the other by violent means.</p>
   <p>As crucifixion was envisaged primarily as pulling apart of the limbs, so scourging also had a similar connotation. The victim was splayed on a frame to receive the lashes, like a starfish stretched out on the sand.79 So in the Jesus story, he is scourged before being crucified. In this case, there is a word—play also involved, since his title, Christ, the "smeared, or anointed with semen", falls together in Aramaic with a verb meaning, "to stretch out".80</p>
   <p>The figure seems well suited to the mushroom, in the splitting of the volva from within, and the stretching of the stem and extension of the canopy. Some such terminology relating to the fungus probably accounts for the stories of the Bacchic Maenads pulling animals and children apart, limb from limb. Pictured in dramatic form, Euripides has Pentheus splayed upon a tree by Dionysus and then pulled down and torn apart by the Maenads in their drug—induced ecstasy.81 In this version of the myth, Pentheus' mother takes an active part in the proceedings and returns from the frolic bearing her son's head proudly before her.82 In the Old and New Testament versions, the chief victims' mothers lead the mourners.</p>
   <p>To summarize: The division of the mushroom volva into two halves gave rise to a "twin" mythology. Since the two constituents of the fungus were envisaged as male and female, it is sometimes personified as a hermaphrodite, and its names like Tubal—Cain, and the Greek Eryngion, contain both male and female elements. Alternatively, the mushroom story presents two figures, usually male, like Castor and Pollux, Cain and Abel, and so on. The most famous of all the mythological twins are Castor and Pollux, the "volva" and the "stem" of the fungus respectively. Their joint name, Dioscouroi, means "phallus of the storm", and appears in the New Testament as the name of Jesus' betrayer, Iscariot, and as the title of Jesus himself, "son of God"</p>
   <p>The risen mushroom, with canopy outstretched was seen by the ancients in the same sexual terms as the open groin of a woman penetrated by the male organ, or as an axe—head into which the shaft has been inserted. It was represented symbolically by the form of a cross, as a man or animal carrying a yoke, or as a criminal crucified. So the fungus was known as "the little cross" and its dismemberment as "crucifixion", giving in part that theme of the Christian myth. The imagery that related the mushroom and the cross extended to "star" images, as we noticed in the case of the Dioscouroi's cap. In many respects the sacred fungus was a child of two worlds, heavenly and terrestrial, and, as the modern Arab calls the mushroom, "star of the ground",83 so in mythology there were always strong astral connections in its worship. Some of these we shall examine in the next chapter.</p>
   
   <h2>XIII. Star of the Morning</h2>
   <p>As Gemini, the Heavenly Twins, the Dioscouroi, were identified specifically with the morning and evening star. Similarly, Jesus proclaims himself to the visionary of the book of Revelation as "the bright and morning star" (Rev 22 :i6).l In part this is a word-play on one of the most important Greek names of the Holy Plant, Peristereon, spelt out within the bilingual Christian communities as the Aramaic Bar —, "son of and the Greek aster, "star", and heds, "of the morning".2 The title "Son of the Star" had already a profound messianic significance within Judaism, deriving the idea from the promise in the Old Testament: "a star shall come forth out of Jacob, and a comet shall rise out of Israel" (Num 24:17). The leader of the Jewish rebels of the Second Revolt in the second century adopted the title as his own, continuing the Zealot tradition that the overthrow of the hated Romans by a star— born Jewish leader was a necessary preliminary to the dawn of the new era. 3</p>
   <p>The more precise relationship between the sacred mushroom and the "bright and morning star" is seen in the oracle of Isaiah, directed at the king of Babylon. He sees the enemy in terms of the fungus whose life, so glorious in its heavenly conception and fulfilment, is yet so short- lived:</p>
   <p>How are you fallen from heaven, Shining One, Son of the Dawn! How are you cut down to the ground, you who laid the nations low! You said in your heart, "I will ascend to heaven; above the stars of God I will set my throne on high; I will sit on the mount of assembly in the far north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will make myself like the Most High." But you are brought down to Sheol, to the depths of the Pit... (Isa 14:12—I 5).</p>
   <p>The application of the mushroom epithet to the Mesopotamian monarch was possible through a similarity between the name of the city "Babylon" and that for the fungus, which came down into Greek as Boubalion, attached, like many fungus names, to the Squirting Cucumber, Elaterlon.4 The phallic connections in the case of that plant are obvious, as they are in the case of the mushroom, and the common name in fact derived from a Sumerian phrase, GU-BAR, "top of the head; glans penis"</p>
   <p>An amusing instance of this same association of the Mesopotamian city—name and the mushroom, this time quite unintentional, is detectable in Pliny's description of a certain parasite which takes possession of a "Babylonian" thorn bush:</p>
   <p>We must not leave out a plant that at Babylon is grown on thorn-bushes, because it will not live anywhere else —just as mistletoe grows on trees, but the plant in question will only grow on what is called the "royal thorn". It is a remarkable fact that it buds on the same day as it has been planted — this is done just at the rising of the dogstar — and it very quickly takes possession of the whole tree. It is used in making spiced wine, and it is cultivated for that purpose. This thorn also grows on the Long Walls at Athens.5</p>
   <p>It is this last phrase which, more than anything, identffies the "thorn" in question. The tradition must have come down to Pliny through Semitic sources which preserved an original name for the mushroom based upon the Sumerian *GU_TJJ_U_DUN, "ball-and-socket; penis-and-vulva", already noticed. It will have been mistakenly understood as the Semitic phrase kotel — 'Attiind', "long wall of Athens", and hence Pliny's strange restriction of the growth of his parasite to this one spot.6 It is by such intentional and unintentional puns on names that botanical references were confused and misapplied, and can in some cases now be restored.</p>
   <p>The morning and evening star is, of course, Venus. To appreciate the relevance of this luminary to the sacred fungus we must try to understand its place in the astral system as anciently understood, and the fertilizing power that it was supposed to wield. Each morning, before the sun-god withdraws his penis from the earth's vaginal sheath, a rival to the heavenly father slips from the nuptial chamber and heralds the coming dawn. This star is second only to the sun and moon in brightness, and usurps some of their glory by lightening the eastern sky in the morning and holding back the veil of night until the moon rises. This star they called Venus, Juno, isis or Aphrodite. Thus Pliny:</p>
   <p>Before the sun revolves, a very large star named Venus, which varies its course alternatively, and whose alternative names in themselves indicate its rivalry with the sun and moon — when in advance and rising before dawn it receives the name of Lucifer, and being another sun and bringing the dawn, whereas when it shines after sunset it is named Vesper, as prolonging the daylight, or as being deputy for the moon... Further it surpasses all the other stars in magnitude, and is so brilliant that alone among stars it casts a shadow by its rays. Consequently there is a great competition to give it a name, some having called it Juno, others Isis, others the Mother of the Gods.7</p>
   <p>As we may now understand, their names for "star" show that the ancients pictured these luminaries as penes in the sky,8 their light fancifully seen as the "glow" of the glans' fiery crown. At first sight it seems then strange that this most powerful of all stars should be given female names like Venus and Juno. The reference, however, is to its generative power. When this lesser penis of heaven slipped from the connubial bower before its master, it came &amp;ipping with the semen of the terrestrial womb. The sun, yawning and stretching its blazing path across the sky would bum away the fragrant drops that his forerunner scattered. Until then they would remain as dew on the earth, the most powerful conceptual fluid of Nature. Thus again Pliny: Its influence is the cause of the birth of all things upon the earth; at both of its risings it scatters a genital dew with which it not only fills the conceptive organs of the earth but also stimulates those of all animals.9</p>
   <p>Even the sea creatures were affrcted by this seminal fluid from the sky. Pearls were "born" within the shell by the direct influence of dew; well might Aphrodite have been portrayed sailing ashore on the coast of Cyprus in such a "womb" of the sea bed. Again Pliny: The source and breeding-ground of pearls are shells not much differing from oyster—shells. These, we are told, when stimulated by the generative season of the year, gape open, as it were, and are filled with a dewy pregnancy, and consequently when heavy are delivered, and the offspring of the shells are pearls that correspond to the quality of the dew received:</p>
   <p>If it was a pure inflow, their brilliance is conspicuous, but if it was turbid, the product also becomes dirty in colour. Also if the sky was lowering, they say, the pearl is pale in colour: for it is certain that it was conceived from the sky, and that pearls have more connexion with the sky than with the sea..</p>
   <p>If the dew could penetrate even to these "volvae" of the sea, its undiluted sprinkling on dry land could be expected to produce powerful drugs:</p>
   <p>After the rising of each star, but particularly the principle stars, or of a rainbow, if rain does not follow but the dew is warmed by the rays of the sun... drugs (medicamenta) are produced, heavenly gifts for the eyes, ulcers, and internal organs. And if this substance is kept when the dog- star is rising, and if, as often happens, the rise of Venus or Jupiter or Mercury falls on the same day, its sweetness and potency for recalling mortals' ills from death is equal to that of the Nectar of the gods.' 1</p>
   <p>So it was, when the Israelites awoke in the desert after an evening of filling their bellies with quail flesh, it was to discover that the "spermal emission" of the dew had left behind it Manna, the "bread" of heaven, which we may identify with the sacred fungus (Exod 16:13f.)-12 We shall see later how mushroom worship was closely connected with necromancy, that is, the raising of the spirits of the dead for fortune-telling. 13 It is in this context that we should now read a passage in Isaiah:</p>
   <p>"0 dwellers in the dust, awake and sing for joy ! For thy dew is a dew of light, and on the land of the shades (Rephaim) thou wilt let it fall" (Isa 26:19). The "Rephaim", as their name can now be seen to mean, were those "cast down from heaven",14 the fallen angels of the sixth chapter of Genesis, and a common theme of Jewish mythology. As the morning dew brought forth the sacred mushroom, so, in the eyes of the prophet, would it give life to these denizens of the underworld. Pliny draws a further connection between dew and the Holy Plant when he says that even the demonic power of the Mandrake is increased when touched with morning dew.'5 In a very special way, then, the sacred fungus was the offspring of the Morning Star, as Jesus proclaims himself to be to the mystic. It thus had the unique ability of forming a bridge between man and god, being not entirely divine nor yet merely mortal. It gave men the power to become for a little while like the gods, "knowing good and evil". 18 Like the mushroom itself, it allowed mortals to become "Dioscouroi", as the Greeks understood that name of the sacred fungus, "Sons of God". As the New Testament writer says of Jesus:</p>
   <p>To all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God; who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; we have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father... (John I:12f.). The mysteries that the "Jesus" — fungus could impart were heavenly in origin, since it itself, as its Hebrew name implies, is "That—which— comes-from-heaven".'7 Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen... No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven, the son of man (John :i if.). Because the mushroom's affinities were primarily celestial, it was thought able to control heavenly phenomena, the atmosphere, winds, and tempests. The Dioscouroi were seen in the atmospheric electrical discharges known as St Elmo's fire, and to our airmen in the war as "gremlins" that accompanied them on their missions. Thus again, Pliny:</p>
   <p>Stars also come into existence at sea and on land. I have seen a radiance of star—like appearance clinging to the javelins of soldiers on sentry duty at night in front of the rampart: and on a voyage stars alight on the yards and other parts of the ship, with a sound resembling a voice, hopping from perch to perch in the manner of birds. These when they come singly are disastrously heavy and wreck ships, and if they fall into the hold burn them up. If there are two of them they denote safety and portend a successful voyage; and their approach is said to put to flight the terrible star called Helena: for this reason they are called Castor and Pollux, and people pray to them as gods for aid at sea. They also shine round men's heads at evening time; this is a great portent. All these things admit of no certain explanation; they are hidden away in the grandeur of Nature. 18</p>
   <p>In their capacity as saviours of men in storms, the writer of the Homeric Hymns lauds the Dioscouroi thus:</p>
   <p>Bright eyed Muses, tell of the Tyndaridae, the Sons of Zeus, glorious children of neat—ankled Leda; Castor, the tamer of horses, and blameless Polydeuces. When Leda had lain with the dark-clouded Son of Cronos, she bare them beneath the peak of the great hill Taygetus, — children who are deliverers of men on earth and swift-going ships when stormy gales rage over the ruthless sea. Then the mariners call upon the sons of great Zeus with vows of white lambs, going to the forepart of the prow. But the strong wind and the waves of the sea lay the ship under 'vater, until suddenly these two are seen darting through the air on tawny wings. Forthwith they allay the blasts of the cruel winds and still the waves upon the surface of the white sea; fair signs are they and deliverance from toil. And when the mariners see them they are glad and have rest from their pain and labour. 19</p>
   <p>Well might Paul's "Alexandrian ship" out of Malta carry the sign of the Dioscouroi at its mast— head (Acts 28:1 i).</p>
   <p>Part at least of the ancient belief that the Dioscouroi could avert storms lies in the idea that in nature like repels like. The antidote to any poison will be found in an object or drug most nearly resembling the baneful source. Since the Dioscouroi, Pollux and Castor, are basically mushroom demons and the source of the "Sons of Thunder" is the storm, it follows that the sacred fungus will have the power to repel the tempest. Similarly, since the Amanita muscaria is a denizen of the conifer forests, and receives its being on the mother's side, as it were, from the "menstrual blood" of the cedar,2° this substance also can affect storms. Thus Pliny:</p>
   <p>They say that hail-storms and whirlwinds are driven away if menstrual fluid is exposed to the very flashes of lightning: that stormy weather is thus kept away, and that at sea exposure, even without (actual) menstruation, prevents storms.21</p>
   <p>In the mushroom's supposed power over the weather lies the basis of the quelling of the storm mythology of the New Testament and of Jonah:</p>
   <p>But Yahweh hurled a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship threatened to break up. Then the mariners were afraid and each cried to his god; and they threw the cargo that was in the ship into</p>
   <p>the sea, to lighten it for them. But Jonah had gone down into the bowels of the ship and had lain down and was fast asleep. So the captain came and said to him, "What's the matter, sleeper? Get up and call on your god! Perhaps the god will give us a thought that we don t perish.</p>
   <p>After casting lots to find out who was to blame among them for their plight and the god's wrath, the sailors discover that Jonah was the culprit, since he was fleeing from the face of Yahweh.</p>
   <p>Then they said to him, "What shall we do to you, that the sea may abate for us?" For the sea was becoming more and more tempestuous. He said to them, "Take me up and throw me into the sea; then the sea will quieten down for you.</p>
   <p>This the sailors eventually did, praying at the same time to be freed from blood-guilt on Jonah's account, "and the sea ceased from its raging" (Jonah 1: 4—15).</p>
   <p>Compare now the story of Jesus and his disciples on the Galilean sea:</p>
   <p>On that day when evening had come, he said to them, "Let us go across to the other side." And leaving the crowd they took him with them, just as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him. And a great storm of wind arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already filling. But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care if we perish?" And he awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still !" And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. And he said to them, "Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?" And they were filled with awe, and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even wind and sea obey him?" (Mark 435—41).</p>
   <p>In both stories the underlying factor is the supposed ability of the sacred fungus to quieten storms. However, as with other such myths as expounded in the Bible, there are several layers of literary construction. For example, behind the whole of the Jonah story there is probably a play on the name of the sacred fungus, latterly known in Greek as Peristereon, but originally the Sumerian *BAR_USh_TAR_IAU_NA.22 In whatever form it was known among the Semites, the name was capable of being teased out by the myth-makers into something like bar-setara' — y6nd', "Jonah — son-of-hiding, concealment", on which that element of the Jonah story about his flight from Yahweh's presence would appear to have been used.</p>
