    <div class="body">
      <p>that he puts into the mouth of the Zealot leader in Masada, one Eleazar, must certainly be fictitious, not least in that he is made to blame his fellow sectarians for the misery the revolt had brought upon the Jews:</p>
      <p>For it was not of their own accord that those flames which were driving against the enemy turned back upon the wall constructed by us; no, all this hetokens wrath at the many wrongs which we dared to inflict upon our countrymen 20</p>
      <p>There is one section of the speech, however, which if it is not a verbatim report of what Eleazar actually said, may be assumed to be a summary of Zealot ideas about the nature of the soul and its loose association with the body:</p>
      <p>For from of old, from the first dawn of intelligence, we have been continually taught by those precepts, ancestral and divine — confirmed by the deeds and noble spirit of our forefathers — that life, not death, is man's misfortune. For it is death which gives liberty to the soul and permits it to depart to its own pure abode, there to be free from all calamity. But so long as it is imprisoned in a mortal body and tainted with all its miseries, it is, in sober truth, dead, for association with what is mortal ill befits that which is divine.</p>
      <p>True, the soul possesses great capacity, even while incarcerated in the body; for it makes the latter</p>
      <p>its organ of perception, invisibly swaying it and directing it onward in its actions beyond the range of mortal nature. But it is not until, freed from the weight that drags it down to earth and clings about it, the soul is restored to its proper sphere, that it enjoys a blessed energy and a power untrammelled on every side, remaining, like God himself, invisible to human eyes Let sleep furnish you with a most convincing proof of what I say — sleep, in which the soul, undistracted by the body, while enjoying perfect independence the most delightful repose, holds converse with God by right of kinship, ranges the universe and foretells many things that are to come.</p>
      <p>One is reminded of what the historian had said about the Essenes in similar vein:</p>
      <p>For it is a fixed belief of theirs that the body is corruptible and its constituent matter impermanent, but that the soul is immortal and imperishable. Emanating from the finest ether, these souls become entangled, as it were, in the prison-house of the body, to which they are dragged down by a sort of natural spell; but</p>
      <p>when once they are released from the bonds of flesh, then, as though liberated from a long servitude, they rejoice and are borne aloft. 22</p>
      <p>This belief that the soul could roam at will, once the body was asleep, lies at the base of drug philosophy of the ancient world. Its rQHry is that information gained whilst in that condition is necessarily more accurate than what can be reasoned by the brain under normal conditions. It was this confidence in their own prophecies of the future, and their inalienable right to determine other people's lives that made such religious fanatics a menace to themselves and their fellow-men. Given the idea that they had been vouchsafed by the god a source of knowledge unshared by other mortals, and were thus raised above the rest of the world as a master-race, this self-delusion could and did become a major political hazard. The kingdom of God became the kingdom of this world. We may wonder, therefore, whether we should not see behind the complimentary title "Zealots", Hebrew  Qanna'im,23  another word of exactly similar form corresponding to the Arabic gannati — nna'imi,  "gardens of delight", deriving as we have seen, from the Sumerian mushroom title, *GAN_NA JM_A_AN. If this is so, it places the first- century Zealots in the same category of mushroom-worshippers and users of the powerful drug obtained there from as the frantic Maenads and the Christians, similarly the object of persecution by upholders of law and order. That the Sumerian form just cited did in fact come into Hebrew at a very early stage is indicated by the name given in the Bible to the oldest inhabitants of the country around Hebron and Philistia, the  'Andqim,  in all probability a jumbled form of the Sumerian *GAN... NA-IM—A-AN.24 These "great and tall people" (Deut 9:2) were identified with "giants"  (gigantes)  by the early Greek translators.25 We saw earlier how that word derived from a Sumerian original meaning, "sky- shade", implying a mighty man holding up the canopy of heaven, and how from the original form came the Greek  Antimimon,  as one of the names of the Mandrake.26 It is, furthermore, to the same root that we may probably trace one of the Greek titles of the mushroom-twins, the Dioscouroi,  Anakes.27 Other indications also point to the identification of the "Zealots" with the sacred fungus. They were otherwise known as the Sicarii, or Assassins. At least, it is generally assumed that where Josephus speaks of these "bandits", as he calls them, he is talking of the Zealots or ruffians associated with them. The passage is worth quoting in full since it indicates the kind of religious fanaticism which Josephus blames for the Jewish troubles of the first-century:</p>
      <p>But while the country was being cleared of these pests, a new species of bandits was springing up in Jerusalem, the so-called Sicarii, who committed murders in broad daylight in the heart of the city. The festivals were their special seasons, when they would mingle with the crowd, carrying concealed under their clothing, short daggers with which they stabbed their enemies. Then when they fell, the murderers joined in the cries of indignation and, through this plausible behaviour, were never discovered. The first to be assassinated by them was Jonathan, the High Priest; after his death there were numerous daily murders. The panic created was more alarming than the calamity itself; everyone as on a battlefield hourly expecting death. Men kept watch at a distance on their enemies and would not even trust their friends when they approached. Yet, even while their suspicions were aroused and they were on their guard, they fell; so swift were the conspirators and so crafty in eluding detection. Besides these there arose another body of villains, with purer hands but more impious intentions, who no less than the assassins ruined the peace of the city. Deceivers and impostors, under the pretence of divine inspiration fostering revolutionary changes, they persuaded the multitude to act like madmen, and led them out into the desert under the belief that God would there give them tokens of deliverance</p>
      <p>A still worse blow was dealt at the Jews by the Egyptian false prophet. A charlatan, who had gained for himself the reputation of a prophet, this man appeared in the country, collected a following of about thirty thousand dupes, and led them by a circuitous route from the desert to the mount called the Mount of Olives...28</p>
      <p>The name Sicarii is usually assumed to be a reference to the short sickle blade (Latin  sica)  carried by the assassins under their cloaks. Elsewhere, Josephus says that "they employed daggers, in size resembling the scimitars of the Persians, but curved and more like the weapons called by the Romans  sicae. "288  We may now reasonably suppose that the real allusion is to the sacred mushroom, the  saqrdtiyiin  of the modern Persian, the "Iscariot" of the New Testament story, the "Dioskouroi" of the classicists.29 Certainly the  s-k-r  root and its variants came into Indo—European as in Semitic with the meaning of "curved", like the sickle-blade weapon, but its root as now we see lay in the Sumerian *USh_GU_RI, "knobbed bolt; phallus", which gave the name to the fungus. It was the curved top of the mushroom canopy that gave that connotation to the root.3°</p>
      <p>It would seem then that the "Zealots" and the "Sicarii" are one and the same, and that the common reference to both names is the sacred mushroom that gave them their dangerous hallucinations and much of their motive force. These Jewish fanatics were not the only drug-maddened lunatics to disrupt society with their inated notions of self- importance and belief in a divinely ordained mission to change the world order. As we shall see in the next section, Islam, too, has had its "Zealots" prompted very probably by the same drug. The " gardens of delight", the.Muslims and their "Zealots" In the Muslim Scriptures, Paradise is a wholly delightful place. Thus speaks the Qur'an on the subject:</p>
      <p>Lo, the pious are in a secure position, among Gardens and springs, wearing silk and brocade, facing each other. So it is! and we have paired them with wide-eyed houris; calling therein for every kind of fruit, in security (Sur 4ci—s5).</p>
      <p>Lo, the pious are in Gardens and delight  (na'im),  enjoying what their Lord has bestowed upon them, and their Lord has protected them from the punishment of Hot Place. "Eat and drink with relish, for what ye have been doing." Reclining upon couches ranged in rows, and we have paired them with wide-eyed houris... (Sur</p>
      <p>Those who go before... are in the Gardens of Deli  ght(gannati-nna' imi),  a company from former generations, and a few from later. Upon bejeweled (?) couches they recline facing each other, while around circle boys of perpetual youth, with goblets and jugs, and a cup of flowing (wine), from which they suffer neither headache nor intoxication, and with fruit of their own choice, and bird's flesh of what they desire, and wide-eyed houris like treasured pearls — a reward for what they have been doing (Sur 56:10—23).</p>
      <p>Wherever Muhammad found his (earthly) inspiration for the picture of heaven he paints in the Qur'an, it must have been within a community which still knew the name of the sacred fungus "gan-Na'iman" and associated it with the "tree of life" of Paradise, the "Garden of Sex" as the name probably meant originally.31 Indeed, one of the many puzzles about the Qur'an and the Arabian prophet is where he found hisJudaeoChristian ideas.32 That he was in touch with Jewish and Christian communities throughout his life and work is, of course, well known. But some of his versions of Bible stories, of the Old and the New Testament, are so strange and so interesting in themselves, that scholars have long been puzzled to know how many of them came to be in such aberrant forms, and under what circumstances the Prophet could have heard or misconstrued them. Even more interesting is the special vocabulary that he uses in the Qur'an. He employs words which are often not Arabic and are certainly derived from Christian Aramaic sources,33 but sometimes with a peculiar connotation unexampled elsewhere. One or two very special phrases, like the "gardens of delight" above, seem to stem directly from the mushroom cult, and remembering that by his time (seventh century AD) the Church had managed to purge itself of its "heresies", driving these communities out into the deserts, one may reasonably wonder if some of the Christian communities with whom Muhammad fraternized may not have been more truly representative of the older and truer "Christianity" than the Byzantine Church that had taken their place. Here also, there is a promising field for fizrther research.</p>
      <p>For example, one intriguing problem about the Prophet's revelations of Paradise is the source of his ideas about the "wide—eyed houris" who 'were so warmly to entertain the heroes of Islam. Indeed, the precise significance of the epithet he applies to them of "wide—eyed" has been a matter for debate.34 Literally the Arabic words mean "white of eye" signifying that the white of the eye has been accentuated, setting off the darkness of the pupil. As we know, this can be achieved cosmetically by painting the lids with a dark pigment. A woman so adorned is called in Aramaic  mestabdthJ',  of the root  s — b — t,  "set right".35 (Our word "cosmetics" comes from the Greek  cosmos,  properly "that which is in order", so the "universe". Cosmetics are, then, literally, what put a girl "right", at least, in theory.)</p>
      <p>It appears that Muhammad, in his description of the fair inhabitants of Paradise, is heir to a very old piece of word-play between the Aramaic  mestabathd' , "adorned woman", and the Sumerian mushroom name *MASh_TjlJ_BA_PJ_TI.S6 We see it again in the story of jezebel in an incident which is otherwise connected with mushroom nomenclature.</p>
      <p>When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her eyes, and adorned her head, and looked out of the window. And as Jehu entered the gate, she said, "Is it peace, you Zimri, murderer of your master?" (II Kgs 9:30—3 r).</p>
      <p>In "murderer of your master" it is not difficult to see a word-play on the plant-name Cotyledon, which we already noticed as derived from the Sumerian GU-TAL-U-DUN, ball-and-socket; penis-and-vulva and thus to be related to the sexual characteristics of mushroom imagery. 37 Jezebel has become the prime exponent of the seductive art through her biblical portrayal, and similarly the "wide-eyed houris" of Muhammad s Paradise are the adorned ones, the Semitic reading of the sacred fungus. We may therefore deduce that wherever the Prophet found his religious vocabulary relating to heaven, they were identifying by word-play the  "ganNa 'iman ", "Adonis-garden" or "garden of delight", with the  mestabdthJ',  "adorned one", and Muhammad, not unreasonably took it that these ladies were the inhabitants of the heavenly gardens. The New Testament has the same word-play in a passage whose fresh elucidation leads on to discovering more about Muhammad and his "Muslims". In the first epistle of Peter there is a long 24)Lon the necessity for women to be submissive to their husbands. It reads: Likewise, you wives, be submissive to your husbands, so that some, though they do not obey the word, may be won without a word by the behaviour of their wives, when they see your reverent and chaste behaviour. Let not yours be the outward adorning with braiding of hair, decoration of gold, and wearing of robes; but let it be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable jewel of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious. So once the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves and were submissive to their husbands, as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are now her children if you do right and let nothing terrify you (I Pet 3:1—7).</p>
      <p>The whole passage has probably been woven together from the same name of the sacred mushroom, *MASh...T_BA_RI...TI from which the astute author derived Aramaic expressions for "be willing",38 "be adorned", and "hope".39 Of the over-all tenor of the passage and its matrimonial relevance, either in the first century or in the twentieth, we need not dwell. We shall have occasion later to discuss the validity of the ethics and homiletic teachings of the Bible in the light of our new understanding of the cryptic nature of so much of the text. What is of more importance for the moment is the word-play between the Aramaic mestebit ha', "submissive", and the mushroom name *MASh_T/.l_ BA-RI-TI, and its possible source for Muhammad's teaching. For the Prophet called his followers "The Submissive Ones", Muslims, literally, "those who have handed themselves over, are submissive",40 and this complete submissiveness is an important characteristic of the religion, amounting in Western eyes often to a quite unacceptable fatalism. To the women of the East, this doctrine of submission has brought tragic results, symbolized by the veil which even now after some thirteen centuries is being cast aside only with the greatest difficulty. When, to the utter astonishment and disgust of the wives of his first Medinan followers, the Prophet insisted on their submission to their menfolk, tradition has it that the innovation met with some resistance. For among the desert-dwelling folk at least the women mixed freely with the men before the coming of Islam.41 Muhammad's faithful disciple Omar is said to have bitterly complained that the men of his tribe used to dominate their women but "when we came among the 'Helpers' (the Ansar ofMedina), they proved to be a people whose women dominated them, and our wives have come to copy the habits of the women of the Ansar".41 a How far pre—Islamic Arabia was a matriarchal society is in ispute; perhaps the movement towards a patriarchal system was already in progress by the seventh century.4 lb Nevertheless, not all the women of the Faith accepted the veil so easily. The niece of'A'isha, the Prophet's favourite wife, asserted her independence and persisted in going unveiled before all men despite her husband's protests.41c</p>
      <p>In fact, the Qur'an is not at all clear in those texts41' 1 which have been understood as making the veil obligatory, and it seems more than likely that the extremes to which the seclusion of women was taken in Islam owed more to the interpretation of later Persian theologians than the Qur' an itself.41e Nevertheless, the principle of "submission" was basic to the new Faith, and we may well wonder now whether this doctrine derived from the kind of Petrine homiletics we have just noticed, coming ultimately from wordplay upon the name of the sacred fungus. Thus, anyway, the Qur'an speaks on the rightful attitude of women:</p>
      <p>The men are overseers over the women by reason of what Allah has bestowed in bounty upon one more than the other, and of the property which they have contributed (the marriage-price). Upright women are therefore submissive, guarding what is hidden in return for Allah's guarding them. Those on whose part ye fear refractoriness, admonish, avoid in bed, and beat. If they then obey you, seek no (further) way against them (Sur4:38). The Assassins</p>
      <p>The demand made by Islam upon its adherents for "self-surrender" and submission to the will of Allah, was carried to its greatest extremes in the fanatical sect known as the Assassins. Theologically they were of the Shi'ite branch of Islam, but their external policies were marked, like the Jewish Zealots, by utter ruthlessness in removing from their path any person who disagreed with their ideas. This they achieved by raising within their group a band of young fanatics called the  Fida'is,  the "devoted ones".42 They were known more generally as "Assassins" because their complete subservience to the will of their religious masters, without regard for personal danger, was the result of their taking a drug known as  khashish,  our "Hashish".48</p>
      <p>The sect was formed as a secret society around 1090 when they won control, by stratagem, of the mountain fortress of Alainut in Persia. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries they and their successors spread terror throughout Persia and Syria, and were finally only put down after some 12,000 of them had been massacred. For some time small bodies of Assassins lingered on in the mountains of Syria, and some think the cult is not entirely dead even now.</p>
      <p>The herb which gave them their name,  khaslzish,  "Hashish", means in Arabic no more than "dried herbage". If used of a particular drug it properly requires some qualification, like "Red Hashish",, meaning Belladonna, Deadly Nightshade.4-4 The word Hashish alone has become attached to one particular form,  Cannabis sativa,  or Hemp, and the enervating drug made from its resin. But it is difficult to believe that the "pot"-smokers of today, the weary dotards who wander listlessly io,  regardless of their safety, stormed castles and stole as assassins into the strongholds of their enemies. If their "Hashish" correctly interprets Cannabis then the latter must represent some more potent drug.</p>
      <p>The Greek word  Kannabis  may now be traced to the Sumerian element GAN, "mushroom top", followed by the word which we saw earlier was part of the name of the New Testament Barnabas, and meant "red, speckled with white",5 denoting, in other words, the colour of the  Amanita muscaria.  As well as the transfer of its name to the less powerful "Hashish", it underwent a jumbling of its form to produce the Greek  Panakes,46  a mysterious plant also called Asciepion (elsewhere used of the mushroom), which required atonement to the earth of various cereals when pulled up.47 It seems, therefore probable that the original Cannabis was the sacred fungus, and that the drug which stimulated the medieval Assassins to self—immolation was the same that brought the Zealots to their awful end on Masada a millenium earlier. Indeed, we may now seriously consider the possibility that the Assassin movement was but a resurgence of a cultic practice that was part of Islam from the beginning, and had its real origin thousands of years before that. It seems to be a pattern of religious movements based on the sacred fungus that long periods of relative calm and stagnation are interspersed with flashes of violent extremism which die away again after persecution, only to re—emerge in much later generations. In this, history is reflecting the action of the drug itself on its partakers. After hectic bouts of uncontrolled activity, the fungus-eater will collapse in a stupor from which only a resurgence of the stimulatory poison in his brain will arouse him.</p>
      <p>Israelitism was based upon the cult of the sacred fungus, as its tribal names and mythologies now show. The extremes of some of its adherents bred their own internal and external opposition, and after the disastrous rebellions against the Assyrians and Babylonians of the eighth and sixth centuries c, a period of reaction set in, and the past was forcibly expunged from Judaism under the reform movements of the sixth—fifth centuries. The mushroom cult went underground to reappear with even more disastrous results in the first and second centuries  A.D  when the Zealots and their successors again challenged the might of Rome.</p>
      <p>Christianity purged itself after the holocaust and drove its drug- takers into the desert as "heretics", and eventually so conformed to the will of the State that in the fourth century it became an integral part of the ruling establishment. By then its priests were raising wafers and sweet wine at the altar and trying to convince their followers that the host had miraculously become the flesh and juice of the god.</p>
      
      <h2>XIX. The Bible as a Book of Morals</h2>
      <p>Our new understanding of the relationship of the Indo-European and Semitic languages has opened up fresh fields of exploration. We are at the beginning of what could be the most fruitful and exciting period in the study of our own culture and its origins since objective, scientific research began. Now that we can decipher the old god and hero names and lay bare the fundamental conceptions of the ancient philosophies and nature—religions, we can better appreciate the import and motifs of their mythologies.</p>
      <p>As far as the Bible is concerned, our new appreciation of the origins of Yaliwism within the fertility philosophy and not, as has been commonly supposed, in opposition to it, means that we must start again in assessing the part played by the prophets in the cult's development. The old chronological framework on which so much of our understanding of religious "progress" has in the past been based is in ruins. The road from Abraham in Ur of the Chaldees through the patriarchs and Moses to the prophets and Jesus of Nazareth has vanished. Development there certainly was: the crude fertility imagery which saw a mighty penis in the sky ejaculating spermatozoa every time it rained had become by the first century, and indeed long before, a more sophisticated mystery religion. The remote phallic deity in the heavens could now be apprehended by the believer in possession of the secrets of the drug plants and fungi. For the first time we can begin to understand the precise reference of some of the prophetic utterances about contemporary Yahwism. We have noticed a few instances, particularly in the book of Isaiah, where fresh light has been thrown on the place of the cultic prostitute in the local religious practices, and the nature of the "gardens" that she tended. In such places the prophet seems utterly opposed to the mushroom cult. On the other hand, where, for example, Ezekiel decries the cultic abominations of the Jerusalem temple, the phallic processionals and the women bewailing Tammuz, the very nature of the vision that transports him from Mesopotamia to Jerusalem and the apparitions of whirling, eye-studded wheels, are very reminiscent of the reported psychedelic effects of the drugs of the  Amanita muscaria.  Furthermore, the worship of the sacred fungus, as we can now appreciate, was an essential part of the oldest Hebrew heritage. Many of the patriarchal legends and names are based on mushroom imagery and nomenclature. As we saw, mushroom worship, by its own extreme nature, its fanaticism and bouts of uncontrolled frenzy, bred its own opposition among normal people. More balanced religionists condemned these aspects of the cult, and the Old Testament records successive attempts by kings and prophets to purge its "abominations" from the land. But they were too deeply rooted to be wholly successful. Even the most intensive and successful of the purges, carried through with ruthless intensity during the Nehemiah-Ezra reforms after the Exile, simply drove the mushroom cult underground, whence it re-emerged in later centuries far more dangerously in the politically orientated movements, Zealotism and Christianity.</p>
      <p>We must abandon then any over-simplification of the religious picture presented by the Old Testament: it is not the story of one people's revolt against the heinous fertility worship of the land to which their desert god had led them. Despite the dramatic episode of Elijah on Mount Carmel, the theme is not Yahweh versus Baal. Yahweh  was  Baal, as he was Zeus and Jupiter. The names, as we have seen, sound a common note of sexual import. In any case, the old idea that the religion of Yahwism centred upon a glorification of the desert "purity" as against the orgiastic fertility practices of the sown land had never quite as much textual support as some of its propounders liked to think. 1</p>
      <p>If we need radically to reassess the Old Testament traditions in the light of the new discoveries, the New Testament situation is far more bleak as far as the Christian is concerned. We must be in no doubt of the effect that importing a new, mushroom element into the New Testament picture must have on our understanding of the origin and nature of Christianity. It needed only the decipherment of one of the strange, non-Greek phrases in such terms to upset the whole previous picture of the beginning and growth of the Church. If, for instance, "Boanerges" is correctly to be explained as a name of the sacred fungus, and the impossible "translation" appended in the text, "Sons of Thunder", is equally relevant to the mushroom, then the validity of the whole New Testament story is immediately undermined. For the pseudo-translation demonstrates an intention of deceit, and since mushrooms appear nowhere in the "surface" tale of Jesus, it follows that the secret reference to the cult must be the true relevance of the whole. If the writers have gone to the trouble of concealing by ingenious literary devices, here, and as we have seen, in many cases elsewhere, secret names of the mushroom, not only must its worship have been central to the religion, but the exigencies of the time must have demanded they should be transmitted among the initiates and their successors in a way that would not bring their enemies down upon them. It therefore follows that the "surface" details of the story, names, places, and possibly doctrinal teachings must be equally as false as the pseudo-renderings of the secret names.</p>
      <p>One immediate result of the cracking of the already very fragile skin of the New Testament story is that all those doubts about its details which have so exercised scholars over the years are brought sharply back into focus. There always have been extreme difficulties in understanding the story of Jesus. There are in the New Testament picture many kinds of problems posed on historical, geographical, topographical, social, and religious grounds, which have never been resolved. But to the Christian scholar they have always seemed of less relevance than the apparently incontrovertible fact of the existence of one, semi-divine man who set the whole Christian movement in motion, and without whose existence the inauguration of the Church would seem inexplicable. But if it now transpires that Christianity was only a latter-day manifestation of a religious movement that had been in existence for thousands of years, and in that particular mystery-cult form for centuries before the turn of the era, then the necessity for a founder-figure fades away, and the problems that have for so long beset the exegete become far more urgent. The improbable nature of the tale, quite apart from the "miracle" stories, the extraordinarily liberal attitude of the central figure towards the Jewish "quislings" of the time, his friendly disposition towards the most hated enemies of his people, his equivocation about paying taxes to the Roman government, the howling of Jewish citizens for the blood of one of their own people at the hands of the occupying power, features of the Gospel story which have never rung true, now can be understood for what they have always been:</p>
      <p>Parts of a deliberate attempt to mislead the authorities into whose hands it was known the New Testament documents would fall. The New Testament was a "hoax", but nevertheless a deadly serious and extremely dangerous attempt to transmit to the scattered faithful secrets which the Christians dare not permit to fall into unauthorized hands but to whose preservation they were irrevocably committed by sacred oaths.</p>
      <p>Let it be repeated: if even one only of the mushroom references of the cryptic phrases of the New Testament text were correct, then a new element has to be reckoned with in the nature and origin of the Christian religion. This new element, furthermore, is the key that fits the phenomenon of Christianity firmly into the surrounding mystery cult pattern of the Near East; but it does so at the cost of the validity of the surface story which knows nothing ostensibly of mushroom cults and which offers for its sacred cultic titles and invocations deliberately false "translations". This is not, then, the record of an evangelistic crusade, an open-armed invitation to all men to join a new society of the redeemed, whose sacred meal is no more than a service of remembrance. It is not the manifesto of an organization whose revolutionary tendencies go no further than the exercise of a group communism of property, but whose teaching urges women to submit at all times to their husbands, and slaves to their masters, being "obedient with fear and trembling". It was not for this pacificism that the Romans dragged forth the celebrants of the Christian mysteries and butchered them.</p>
      <p>But if the stories of Jesus are no more historically real than those of Adam and Eve, Jacob and Esau, and even of Moses, what of the moral teachings of the Bible? Whilst it is true that, freed of the pious inhibitions we so often brought to the Scriptures, we can now more readily appreciate the literary qualities and humour of the legends, we have also to acknowledge that Jews and Christians have not gone to their Bibles for entertainment, or to be enlivened by its merry tales. Generations of believers have sought in these Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek works the very Word of God. They have believed that here were enshrined laws for all mankind through which alone moral stability could be achieved, and defiance of which would mean ruin and punishment, if not in this life, in the next. The very dubiety of much of the text hs seemed to many added reason for believing in its divine inspiration. The question has now to be asked, supposing for the moment that there ever was any foundation for the belief that the Bible was a guide-book to moral living, how far can our new appreciation of the origins and nature of Judaism and Christianity continue to give its teachings universal authority?</p>
      <p>This, perhaps, is the most crucial issue raised by the present discoveries. It is not just that Jesus, and probably Moses, disappear from history; this loss might still be borne with equanimity, at least by those uncommitted to the religions they represent, if the teachings attributed to them could still be held as valid. There are many people who are not Jews, and whose "Christianity" stops short of participation in the ritual, but who fervently maintain the authority of the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount. They would argue, without necessarily having studied either passage very closely, that they embody a store of practical experience and moral idealism that will serve mankind for a long time yet, no matter what happens to the religions of Moses and Jesus.</p>
      <p>This is not the place to answer these questions; but it would seem a useful exercise to end our study by setting out afresh for consideration some examples of this moral teaching of the Old and New Testaments, examining their immediate literary sources and keeping these larger issues in mind.</p>
      <p>We might begin with the Ten Commandments, or "Ten Words" as they are called. We earlier saw how the myth of their revelation to Moses on Mount Sinai was formulated.2 The idea of two "tablets" derived from the two halves of the mushroom volva, their round loaf- shape form being that of the very early clay tablets. From the Sumerian name TAB-BA-R/LI(-R/LI) came, indeed, our word "tablet" via the Greek and Latin  tabula.  The number of the commandments, or "words", comes from a play upon the same Sumerian name, in the fuller form MASh-TAB-BA-RI, read as "five words", that is, "five" on each tablet. Here they are: "I am Yahweh your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. "You shall have no other gods before me. "You shall not make yourself a graven image, or any likeness that is in heaven above, of in earth beneath, or in the water that is under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous god, punishing the wrong-doing of fathers upon sons, to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing kindness to intimates, to those who love me and keep my commandments.</p>
      <p>"You shall not swear by Yahweh your God insincerely; for Yahweh I will not clear him who swears by his name insincerely.</p>
      <p>"Take due note of the Sabbath, to set it apart. Six days you shall work and carry out all your tasks, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God. You shall  carry  out none of your tasks, you, or your son, or your daughter, or your manservant, or your maidservant, or your beast, or the stranger who lodges in your house. For in six days Yahweh your God made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and everything in them, and he rested on the seventh day. So he blessed the Sabbath day and set it apart.</p>
      <p>"Honour your father and your mother; in that way you will prolong your life on the land Yahweh your God gives you. "You shall not murder.</p>
      <p>"You shall not commit adultery.</p>
      <p>"You shall not steal.</p>
      <p>"You shall not testify falsely against your neighbour.</p>
      <p>"You shall not long for your neighbour's house; you shall not long for your neighbour's wife, or his manservant, or his maidservant, or his ox, or his ass, or anything your neighbour has."</p>
      <p>As a code of laws these Ten Words leave much to be desired. The* first four, perhaps five, seem to be purely religious and cultic; from the point of view of social relationships only the last five seem relevant, and the last is a matter of attitude rather than directly anti—social action. More serious, the stark commands of the code receive no qualification. In the desert community in which they are generally supposed to have had their primary relevance, "do not murder" and "do not steal" would be incomprehensible, since the Bedouin raid was a way of life and a necessary means of livelihood. Even taken out of this dubiously historical setting, whilst as a general rule of conduct these five commands are obviously good sense, they offer no guide about infringements of the laws, treatment of culprits and the all-important matter of making good damage done to other people.</p>
      <p>Of course, in such aphorisms we should not expect to find the legal niceties stated in all detail: it is a statement of principles rather than legislation. But five or six principles are little enough on which to base a practical guide for the complexities of day-to-day living, of whatever age.</p>
      <p>As a matter of comparison, we might cite a few examples of a real law-code from Mesopotamia around i 700 BC:</p>
      <p>"If a citizen has accused another and charged him with murder, but does not substantiate the charge, the accuser shall be executed.</p>
      <p>"If a citizen has stolen an ox, or a sheep, or an ass, or a pig, or a boat that is the property of the temple or of the crown, he shall make a thirty-fold restitution; but if it is the property of a vassal, he shall make a ten—fold restitution; if the thief is destitute, he shall die.</p>
      <p>"If a citizen gives another for safe custody silver, gold, or anything at all, he must show witnesses everything that he has deposited. He must provide contracts and (only then) hand over the goods for safe custody.</p>
      <p>"If he hands over into custody without witnesses or contracts and the custodian subsequently denies the transaction, then no claim is valid in such a case.</p>
      <p>"If a citizen has handed over anything of his whatsoever for safe custody, and the place where it was lodged is broken into or reached with a ladder, and both his property and that of the house owner is lost, the householder, who has been negligent, shall make restitution for what was deposited with him and was lost, and shall compensate the owner. Furthermore, the householder must search for the lost property and recover it from the thief.</p>
      <p>"If a citizen's wife is caught having sexual intercourse with another male, they shall both be tied up and thrown into the water; if the wife's husband forgives her, then the king may reprieve his servant.</p>
      <p>"If a citizen rapes another's wife, yet a virgin, and they catch him, that man shall be executed; the wife shall go free.</p>
      <p>"If a citizen's wife is accused (of infidelity) by her husband, but she has not been caught in coitus with another male, she must take an oath (of innocence) on the god's name and return home.</p>
      <p>"If a citizen's wife is accused of a relationship with another man, but she has not been caught in coitus with him, for her husband's sake she must throw herself in the river.</p>
      <p>"If a citizen has taken a wife and she suffers from intermittent fever, and if he plans to take another wife, he may do so, but he must not forsake the sick wife. She shall dwell in a house that he shall provide and he must support her for life.</p>
      <p>"If a son strikes his father, his hand shall be cut off.</p>
      <p>"If a citizen destroys the eye of another of equal social status, his eye I shall be forfeit.</p>
      <p>"If he breaks the bone of another citizen, his bone shall be broken.</p>
      <p>"If he destroys the eye or breaks the bone of a vassal, he shall compensate him one mina of silver."</p>
      <p>(from the Stele of Hammurabi, C. 1792—1750 Be)</p>
      <p>It is not the intention, in quoting from these examples of biblical and Mesopotamian laws, to make a comparison in their respective standards of morality. Canons of justice vary with the social stratification of communities. One law for the rich and another for the poor is an immense step forward from the stage where the have-nots could expect no justice at all. In the Hammurabi Code we have a systematic attempt to put the kind of over-all principles crisply stated in the half-dozen or so relevant "Words" of Moses into some practical legislation. It is all very well saying "do not kill", but what happens when someone does shed another's blood and incurs blood-guilt? How does a community avoid family feuds which might trail on for generations? "Do not steal" is a fine sentiment; but there are more ways of stealing than entering somebody else's stockyard and roping one of his steers. A more subtle method is to wait until he entrusts you with his livestock before going on a journey and then swear he left only nine anim31s with you and not ten. The "Ten Commandments", then, always have had to be enlarged upon, limited or extended, to make them relevant for any age, and it is in this adaptation of the principles they enshrine that subjectivity can most operate. If, in certain circumstances, the divine Author of the "Words" will allow you to flout the sixth, who is to decide whether the recipient of your bullet or napalm is a German, Russian, or Viet Cong; an American, Arab, or Jew? Or under what circumstances may you murder for judicial purposes? Yet it is not so much the insufficiency of the Mosaic Code that must now engage our attention as the authority biblical injunctions can any longer command. A close examination of the Ten Words of the Bible show that they are probably derived from word-play on the two prime Sumerian fungus names: MASh-TAB-BA-R/LI(-R/LI) and *LI.MASh...BA(LA)G- ANT A-T AB -B A-R/LI(-R/LI), preceded by the invocatory *E...LA. UIA (-E-LA-UIA). 198</p>
      <p>The preamble "I am Yahweh your God who brought you forth from the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage", is fundamentally based upon the name of the fungus as "the 'Egyptian' mushroom", properly, as we have seen, "the stretched or erect one". The self— identification, "I am Yahweh your God" merely states in normal Hebrew the Sumerian original of those divine names, *E_LA_TJT, "juice of fecundity; sperm"; Hebrew  'Eldhim,  and  Yahweh (Ydho).d The play ii *MASh_BALAG_ANTA and the Semitic phrase for "forced levy"  (mas-palakh,.-pulkhdn)  we noted in connection with Issachar.5 The last part of the name, TAB-BA.-RI gave the play on the root  d-b-r,  "lead</p>
      <p>"You shall have no other gods before me" comes from a play on the repeated invocatory *E_LA_UIA, E-LA-UIA, as if it read "there is no god save Elohim".7 What makes this phrase especially interesting is that it is almost exactly the rallying cry of the Muslim, the witness that he makes on his "self—surrender" and takes the Faith: "There is no god save Allah." Also using the invocatory *E_LA...IJA, repeated, the compilers of the Commandments produced the verbal basis of the third "Word":</p>
      <p>"You shall not swear by Yahweh your God insincerely." Here they have apparently taken E-LA-UIA for a play on the Semitic root  '-i-h,  "swear", used by Hosea when he says of Israel's backsliders: "they utter words — oaths of insincerity" (Hos Io:4).8 For the remainder: "for Yahweh will not clear him who swears by his name insincerely", play is made on the name *MASh_BALA.,..ANTA as if it read "remission of sin Similar word-play underlies the extension to the Law on swearing put into the mouth of Jesus:</p>
      <p>Again, you have heard that it was said to the men of old, "You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn." But I say unto you, Do not swear at all... Let what you say be simply "yes, yes; no, no"; anything more than this comes from evil (Matt 5 :33—37).</p>
      <p>The original reading here was probably, "yes — no; yes — no"; for this in, Aramaic would sound remarkably similar to the invocatory mushroom name, *E...LA_uIA, *E..LA...U.9 The added statement, "anything more than this comes from evil", confirms this, for that phrase is a play on the last part of the name, *MASh_BA(LA)3ANTA, read as "what is surplus (to this is) evil".10</p>
      <p>The whole of the Sabbath legislation of the fourth commandment is verbally based on the same title of the sacred fungus. From it the "lawmakers" derived a Semitic root meaning "be still" and "to praise, hold in respect", and words for "working" and "creation".</p>
      <p>Similarly, "honour your father and your mother" is a rendering of the injunction spun from the fungus name: "give praise to those who created you". 12 The somewhat amoral reason for doing so, "that you may live longer on the land Yahweh your God gives you", is verbally inspired in part by the same Semitic word "honour", which can also mean, "increase, make a profit".'3 The New Testament writers develop the theme in their "fulfillment" of the Law in the mouth of Jesus:</p>
      <p>If a man says to his father or his mother, What you might have profited by me is Corban (that is a Gift) — then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother... (Mark 7:11).</p>
      <p>"Corban" is the technical term for gifts dedicated to God. In the story of Judas Iscariot's blood money, the priests refuse to put the thirty pieces of silver into the "Corban", the temple treasury, because it is tainted with guilt (Matt 27:6). The "interpretation" offered in Mark, "Gift", is hardly a satisfactory rendering of "Corban" and even writing the word with a capital letter does not convey its real import. As elsewhere, we have here a pseudo—translation, offering a clue to the underlying word-play. As far as the "gift" is concerned, the mushroom name *MASh.43A(LA)G... has given the myth-makers the root  s-p-q,  "give what is needful".'4 The technical term is a play on *L14(UR_ BA(LA)G.-ANTA, read as "for Corban" (compare the mushroom name in its Semitic form  khurbekhana').15 "Honouring" one's parents, and "profiting" from the son, derive from a play on the same Semitic root  sh-b—kh,  "praise, honour; give increase, profit"</p>
      <p>"You shall not commit adultery."</p>
      <p>It is the New Testament elaboration on this theme which helps to identify the source of the wordplay and the means of arriving at this terse command, expressed in a single Hebrew verb. At base is the mushroom name *LIKBJ.,AANTA, taken as "using a woman for adultery". 16 On this theme the New Testament expounds in words which perhaps have provoked more mental anguish and self-destruction than any other in the Christian writings: You have heard it said, "You shall not commit adultery." But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart... (Matt 5:27). To this passage should be added:</p>
      <p>And the Pharisees came up and in order to test him, asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?" 17 He answered them, "What did Moses command you?" They said, "Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce, and to put her away." But Jesus said to them, "For your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. But from the beginning of creation, 'God made them male and female.' For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh." So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder. 18</p>
      <p>And in the house the disciples asked him about this matter. And he said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another, commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery" (Mark 10:2—12). The extension of "adultery" to the mind reflects the age-old appreciation that in any moral situation the intention might be more important than the deed. Its statement and application here, however, come from adding TAB-BA-RI to the mushroom name quoted above, and thus reading, "an adulterous association with a woman (is) that which is in the mind". 19 The second passage quotes the statements in Genesis from the Creation story about the joining of the sexes in marriage because "Woman had been taken out of Man" (Gen 2 :23f.). This in itself is a word-play on the mushroom name *LI MASh BA(LA)G ANTA TAB BA RI TI, from which the authors extracted "leaves those who begot him", and 'joined to his wife". Using the same mushroom name, the New Testament writers go further, producing an Aramaic phrase meaning, "from the source of creation".20 The whole "divorce" theme comes by word-play on the name, since the technical word for "sending away a wife" is in Semitic  sh-b. -q  which they saw in *MASh...BA(LA)G.</p>
      <p>The same root means "leave" (as here, "parents", or "home"). A very similar root,  s-p-q  means "join together", and so we have the "joining" of the husband and wife. From the central element in the name, -BALAG-, the authors extracted the Semitic root  p-l — g, "divide", and the phrase about not putting the married couple "asunder" The really crucial injunction for generations of Christians and others in the Western world is the addition attributed in the story to Jesus as a result of further enquiry from his followers:</p>
      <p>Whoever divorces his wife and marries another, commits adultery against her.</p>
      <p>This comes from the two related names of the mushroom, *MAsh_ BA(LA)G-ANTA and *LIK BALAG-ANTA, spelt out into Aramaic phrases as "he who divorces (his) wife" and "for adultery takes the woman (wife)".21</p>
      <p>It might be questioned if, in the social circumstances of the Near East in the first century, or indeed even now, this rule against divorce was either practicable or desirable. The basis of social life and morality in these lands has always been the continuance of the family. A man's sons are his Prudential life policy. If, when he is too old to work, or illness or other disaster overtakes him, he has no family to care for him, the man dies. If a woman can bear him no children, however good she may be at the cooking-pot or cows, she is failing in her prime mission in life. She has to go; or, at least, a more fertile substitute has to be found. If the man is rich enough he may be able to keep both women; but if not, the infertile woman must go back to her family. To forbid divorce in such circumstances makes nonsense of the whole basis for the moral and social stability of the ancient world.</p>
      <p>Perhaps most clearly, indeed poignantly, this injunction about divorce and its Old Testament counterpart, focuses our attention on the larger issues raised by these new discoveries. Were such "moral" teachings ever meant to be taken seriously? Certainly, there is nothing in the literary devices of word—play and biblical allusions which necessarily argues against it. A writer can express great thoughts and emotions by means of puns on important words or as supposed "fulfilments" of ancient laws, even if this method must tend to restrict his style and choice of words. The ideas of the New Testament teaching might still be valid despite the strangeness of the mushroom cult which gave them birth.</p>
      <p>The emphasis placed in the New Testament teachings about "love" and non-retaliation, could, within a small closed society, be practicable. The accounts given by the historians of such in-groups as the Essenes and Therapeutae give that impression of brotherly love and self-control. Even the extraordinary attitude to women and sex and the practice of celibacy which Josephus reports of the Essenes and which became the ideal of the Church, might just be feasible in a desert community of ascetics. Less credible, perhaps, are those mixed settlements of the Therapeutae who kept the sexes strictly apart for most of the time but came together in holy concourse, with singing and dancing, every seven weeks.22</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, what we learn of the Christians from the Romans who had to live with them, or at least had to try and keep the peace in a racially, and religiously fragmented Empire, does little to convince us that the New Testament homiletic teachings were taken seriously by those most immediately concerned. The Roman historian Tacitus, to whom the Christian authorities have looked for the clearest "evidence" of the historicity of Jesus, can hardly find words base enough to use of the sect. "Nero", he says, speaking of the great fire of Rome of July, 64, "fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations,23 called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilatus,24 and a deadly superstition,25 thus checked for the moment, broke out not only in Judea, the first source of the evil, but also in the City (Rome), where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world meet and become popular. Accordingly, an arrest was first made of all who confessed; then, upon their information, an immense multitude was convicted, not so much of the crime of arson, as of hatred of the whole human race."</p>
      <p>Mockery of every sort was added to their deaths. Covered with the skins of beasts, they were torn by dogs and perished, or nailed to crosses, or were doomed to the flames. These served to illuminate the night when daylight failed. Nero had thrown open his gardens for the spectacle, and was exhibiting a show in the circus, while he mingled with the people in the dress of a charioteer or drove about in a chariot. Hence, even for criminals who deserved extreme and exemplary punishment, there arose a feeling of compassion; for it was not, as it seemed, for the public good, but to glut one man's cruelty, that they were being destroyed.26</p>
      <p>How much substance there was in the charge that the Christians had set fire to the city,27 we shall never know. It might well be that their fanatics had translated their visions of a fiery end to the world order into practical reality:</p>
      <p>But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fire, and the earth and the works that are upon it will be burned up. Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of persons ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness, waiting for and urging on the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be kindled and dissolved, and the elements will melt in fire! (II Pet 3 :iof.).</p>
      <p>The political allusions in the book of Revelation have long been recognized, and "Babylon" identified with Rome:</p>
      <p>So shall her plagues come in a single day, pestilence and mourning and famine, and she shall be burned with fire ;for mighty is the Lord God who judges her. And the kings of the earth who committed fornication and were wanton with her, will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning; they will stand far off, in fear of her torment, and say, "Alas! Alas! thou great city, thou mighty city, Babylon! In one hour has thy judgement come" (Rev i8 :8—io).</p>
      <p>Hallelujah! Salvation and glory arid power belong to our God, for his judgements are true and just; he has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and he has avenged on her the blood of his servants.</p>
      <p>Once more they cried, "Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up for ever and ever" (Rev 19:1—3).</p>
      <p>Powerful sentiments, indeed, but hardly likely to endear the Christians to their fellow-men, nor are they exactly expressions of love and universal brotherhood. Well might they be accused of "hatred of the human race"  (odium humani generis).28  In any case, Tacitus, who must have known the Christians at first hand and regarded them as entirely despicable, seems to have considered their arraignment on an antisocial charge as fully justified.</p>
      <p>Suetonius, to whom reference has also been commonly made to support the historicity of the Gospels, says that, around the year  49,  "the Jews constantly made disturbances at the instigation of Chrestus" and were expelled from Rome.29 Whether, even at that early stage, the authorities were being led to believe that the Chrestus, or Christus, was a man and not the source of the "disturbing" drug,3° we cannot tell from this passage. It is not impossible, although the Gospels can hardly have been in circulation around the communities before 70. The passing reference does at least witness to the fractious nature of the sect, and to the hostile attitude of Jews in the city on whom this kind of religious fanaticism, claiming for itself a Jewish origin, would inevitably react to their detriment. The Jewish leaders faced the same desperate situation in Palestine itself twenty years later when the Zealot madmen brought the might of Rome down on their nation because of similarly inspired excesses'</p>
      <p>Elsewhere Suetonius speaks of Christians as "a class of men given to a new and wicked superstition",31 and there seem to have been reports circulating that they practised infanticide, cannibalism, and incest.32 One is reminded of the same things said about the Bacchantes, very probably for the same reason. Outside the societies of initiates, garbled reports about the sacred "Christ"—food, "crucified" and eaten in a common meal, would almost inevitably lead to the idea that the "Christians" were eating human flesh. Indeed, the Catholic worshipper is so assured even today that through the miracle of transubstantiation, he is actually eating Christ's flesh, and drinking his blood.</p>
      <p>If then, there seems little in the picture drawn for us of first-century Christians by contemporary pagan historians that is in any way attractive, how far were the writers of the New Testament homilies serious in there advocacy of love towards all men, and turning the other cheek? Was it valid, if at all, only for members of the closed communities, as the Essenes were told to love one another but detest the outsider?33</p>
      <p>Perhaps even more fundamentally, now that we no longer need to view the Bible through the mists of piety, does it really matter in the twentieth century whether the adherents of this strange JudaeoChristian drug cult thought their community ethics valid for the world at large, or not? If some aspects of the "Christian" ethic still seem worthwhile today, does it add to their authority that they were promulgated two thousand years ago by worshippers of the  Amanita muscaria?</p>
