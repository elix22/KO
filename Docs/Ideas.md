## World
 
#### Story and Environment

- The Last Tree

> The existence of this plant hangs in the balance. The thing that has kept it standing is a community of 23 people living inside a giant tree house that they built in its branches. But now an order came from beyond the mist for eviction of the tree house. Whether or not they comply, within 5 days the tree will be nuked for being abnormal.
> KO/Dizzy becomes really angry and decides to find the source of this unacceptable demand.

- Fake Forest

> Fake Forest is what covers most of the world, _the last tree_ is surrounded by it. Everything is very brightly colored and plastic. There's furries and swarms of fleyes everywhere. Tutorial land.

- Black Iron Prison

> At the end of Mainstreet lies number 101, a giant black pyramid with a golden tip covered in circuitry and barred windows [+]. KO is sent here to file a complaint and kick bubblegum. Upward staircases lead deeper into the dungeon, with every floor decreasing in size, but increasing in complexity and difficulty.

> The first floor has a downwards ladder that leads to a floor with deserted shops and a collapsed downward staircase. (Rogue-like reference a la Diablo2)

> This is the main dungeon for The Curse of Greyface.
